# Paper-Compliler

A workflow to write  scientific documents using markdown and pandoc inspired by [this post](http://inundata.org/2012/12/04/how-to-ditch-word/)

## Prerequisites:

1. [Pandoc](http://http://pandoc.org/)
2.  [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
3.  A .bib file generated by a reference manager (mendeley, zotero, etc.)
4.  Some .csl citation styles according to the type of references needed: you can find some on  [this repo](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles)

## Usage:

There are two scripts, the first one, initiate-manuscript.sh creates all the files nedeed in order to make the paper, the second one, compile-manuscript.sh uses pandoc to make a .pdf and .docx files from manuscript.md
