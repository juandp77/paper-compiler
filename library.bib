abstract = {G ross-total resection (GTR) of intrinsic low-grade gliomas (LGG) in the brain is often difficult given their infiltrative nature and the risk of neurologi-cal morbidity. 1,12,14 Current data on the value of surgical treatment is mostly based on observational studies. 12 Con-sequently, the goal of maximum resection in patients with minimal symptoms remains controversial, despite the fact that those studies show improved overall survival (OS) after GTR. 1,15 Recently, a population-based parallel cohort study conducted in Norway provided very good evidence of improved survival for patients with LGG treated us-ing early surgery as opposed to watchful waiting, the best evidence so far arguing for the former approach. 3 Never-theless, it has been argued that any incremental survival advantage in patients treated with GTR is simply a self-fulfilling prophecy of selection bias. 12 Recent advances in our histopathological, molecular, and genetic under-standing of LGG, however, have prompted more nuanced management strategies. Several significant demographic, clinical, and pathological prognostic factors that can aid the treatment team regarding the use of postoperative ad-juvant therapy have been reported. 2 Advanced age, larger tumor volume, subtotal resection, and diffuse astrocytoma subtype have been found to be associated with unfavor-able outcomes, and additional therapy has had a beneficial effect in patients with these features. 9,10 Recent advances in the molecular and genetic profiling of LGG have result-ed in more accurate survival predictions, which has neces-sitated a thorough examination of the utility of adjuvant therapy after subtotal resection (STR). 6 adjuvant chemotherapy In this issue of Neurosurgical Focus, Nitta et al. pro-vide a treatment strategy for LGG based on extent of re-section with an emphasis on two WHO Grade II subtypes: diffuse astrocytoma and oligodendroglial tumors. Utiliz-ing results from their retrospective cohort study, these au-thors highlight the predictors of OS and progression-free survival (PFS). 9 In both LGG subsets, radiotherapy (RT) did not clearly correlate with an OS or PFS advantage. Al-ternatively, adjuvant chemotherapy with nimustine hydro-chloride (ACNU) and vincristine after STR was strongly associated with increased PFS in the oligodendroglial subtype, but did not confer either an OS or a PFS advan-tage in patients with a diffuse astrocytoma subtype. These findings suggest that the adjuvant treatment of choice in patients with low-grade oligodendroglioma is chemother-apy and possibly repeat surgery in those with low-grade diffuse astrocytoma. However, chemotherapy resulted in a poorer prognosis in oligodendroglioma patients with wild-type IDH1 and prolonged PFS in patients with IDH1 mu-tation and/or 1p/19q codeletion. Overall survival, but not PFS, was found to be significantly associated with IDH1 status, and repeat surgery was suggested for patients with wild-type IDH1 regardless of the histopathological diag-nosis. adjuvant rt The role of surgery, extent of resection, and RT in the long-term outcome for patients with LGGs remains ir-resolute given the paucity of Level 1 data that addresses quality of life and/or OS in both symptomatic and inci-dental LGGs. 4,14 The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 22845 trial, which looked at the long-term efficacy of early versus delayed RT in adults with LGG, was an attempt to determine the role of adjuvant RT. Trial researchers found statistically significant improvement in PFS in the early-irradiated group. Salvage chemotherapy was also administered to 37{\%} of the irradiated patients who had demonstrated clinical or radiographic recurrence.},

@article{Duffau2013,
abstract = {Background and purpose: Surgery for diffuse low-grade glioma (DLGG) was debated for a long time. Discrepancies in the classical literature are mainly due to the lack of objective radiological assessment of the extent of resection (EOR). Here, the goal is to review the recent data on oncological and functional outcomes. Methods: Surgical series with calculation of EOR on postoperative MRI were reviewed. Results: In all modern series, a more aggressive resection predicted significant improvement in overall survival (OS) compared with a simple debulking. Especially, an extended removal of a margin beyond the MRI-defined abnormalities (" supra-total" resection) significantly increased OS by delaying malignant transformation. Furthermore, advances in intraoperative brain mapping techniques resulted in a minimization of neurological deficits. Discussion/Conclusion: These recent data strongly argue in favor of achieving a maximal resection of DLGG as the first therapeutic option. Biopsy should be considered only in very diffuse lesions (gliomatosis) or when a subtotal resection is not a priori possible. Thus, neurosurgeons should change their mind, by operating the brain involved by a chronic tumoral disease rather than by trying to remove a "tumor mass" The aim is not to achieve a simple "tumorectomy", but the most extensive resection of the brain invaded by DLGG, on the condition that this part of the brain is not crucial for cerebral functions. This new philosophy suggests to perform early and maximal resection according to functional (and not purely oncological or anatomical) boundaries in awake patients. This perspective is the best way to build a personalized "functional surgical neuro-oncology". ?? 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

abstract = {The conventional model of language-related brain structure describing the arcuate fasciculus as a key white matter tract providing a direct connection between Wernicke's region and Broca's area has been called into question. Specifically, the inferior precentral gyrus, possessing both primary motor (Brodmann Area [BA] 4) and premotor cortex (BA 6), has been identified as a potential alternative termination. The authors initially localized cortical sites involved in language using measurement of event-related gamma-activity on electrocorticography (ECoG). The authors then determined whether language-related sites of the temporal lobe were connected, via white matter structures, to the inferior frontal gyrus more tightly than to the precentral gyrus. The authors found that language-related sites of the temporal lobe were far more likely to be directly connected to the inferior precentral gyrus through the arcuate fasciculus. Furthermore, tractography was a significant predictor of frontal language-related ECoG findings. Analysis of an interaction between anatomy and tractography in this model revealed tractrography to have the highest predictive value for language-related ECoG findings of the precentral gyrus. This study failed to support the conventional model of language-related brain structure. More feasible models should include the inferior precentral gyrus as a termination of the arcuate fasciculus. The exact functional significance of direct connectivity between temporal language-related sites and the precentral gyrus requires further study.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN A retrospective cohort study. OBJECTIVE To investigate the relationship between spinal cord microstructures and spinal cord dysfunction in degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) patients, a follow-up study was carried out using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI), an advanced diffusion model. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA DTI has been used for diagnosis of DCM. Though DTI has advantages of high sensitivity and quantitative features, it is limited by its low specificity for measuring microstructures. METHODS 58 postoperative DCM patients with 12-14 months of surgical recovery were recruited, as well as 14 healthy volunteers for control group. All DTI and NODDI metrics were measured at the most stenotic levels of patients and at all levels of control group. A t-test was used to compare the metrics between patient and control groups, and Spearman's correlation was used to test the relationship between the metrics and clinical assessment, modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) scores. RESULTS T-test showed that DTI metrics, neurite density Vic, and free water fraction Viso had significant differences between control group and the most stenotic levels in patients. For DTI metrics, fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD) and mean diffusivity (MD) in patients were significantly correlated with mJOA. For NODDI metrics, only Vic is positively correlated with mJOA. CONCLUSIONS The results of t-test and correlation with mJOA suggest that DTI and NODDI are valuable for evaluating spinal cord function. Results of NODDI indicate that the reason for FA reduction in DCM may be decreased neurite density, not increased orientation dispersion. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE 3.},

abstract = {Posterior quadrant dysplasia (PQD) is a rare variant of cortical dysplasia involving the posterior regions of a single hemisphere. It is always associated with early onset, refractory epilepsy often characterized by a "catastrophic" evolution. The experience on its surgical management during the first year of life is limited to sporadic, isolated cases. Between 2002 and 2005, four children less than one-year-old and affected by drug-resistant epilepsy associated with PQD were admitted to our Institution and underwent surgical treatment. One patient remained seizure-free during all the follow-up (Engel I). The remaining three children showed a recurrence of the seizures, requiring subsequent surgical procedures in two cases. In one case (Engel II), the seizure control has been obtained thanks to pharmacological treatment. The other two patients respectively had only a partial (Engel III) and a less relevant reduction of the number of seizures (Engel IV). Both the epileptic and the neuropsychological outcome of our series were significantly influenced by persistent contralateral interictal anomalies rather than by the timing of the surgical procedure. Unpredictable results should be expected in this kind of patients if there is the detection of contralateral independent epileptiform activities on the EEG at diagnosis. Parents and relatives should be aware of the results' variability, even though a reduction of seizures may be expected, enabling an easier handling of the child's condition. ?? 2010 British Epilepsy Association.},

abstract = {Patients with drug-refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) often have hippocampal and amygdaloid damage. The present study investigated the factors associated with the occurrence and severity of damage in patients with partial epilepsy. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure the volumes of the hippocampus and the amygdala in 241 patients with different durations of epilepsy. We also investigated the association of damage with the location of seizure focus and clinical factors (age at onset of seizures, lifetime seizure number and medical history of complex febrile convulsions, intracranial infection or status epilepticus) with regression analysis. We found that high lifetime seizure number (P{\textless}0.05), history of complex febrile convulsions (P{\textless}0.01), and age ≤5 years at the time of the first seizure (P{\textless}0.01) were significant risk factors for reduced hippocampal volume in TLE patients. The severity of amygdaloid damage did not differ between TLE patients with different durations of epilepsy or seizure frequency, but complex febrile convulsions (P{\textless}0.05) and intracranial infection (P{\textless}0.05) were associated with amygdaloid damage. In patients with extratemporal or unclassified partial epilepsy, the hippocampal and amygdaloid volumes did not differ when patients with different durations of epilepsy were compared with controls. The present findings indicate that a high seizure number, the occurrence of complex febrile convulsions, and an early onset of seizures contribute to hippocampal volume reduction in patients with TLE.

abstract = {OBJECT: The authors evaluated their surgical experience over 20 years with 14 treated falcotentorial meningiomas. METHODS: In the past 20 years, 14 patients with falcotentorial junction meningiomas were surgically treated. There were seven men and seven women, whose ages ranged from 34 to 79 years. On the basis of neuroimaging studies, the authors analyzed the influence of the anatomical relationship of the tumor to the vein of Galen, patency of the vein of Galen, tumor size, and the signal intensities on the magnetic resonance images to determine possible difficulties that might be encountered during surgery and to prognosticate the outcome of surgery. Depending on the relationship with the vein of Galen, tumors were labeled as either a superior or an inferior type. All tumors were resected via an occipital transtentorial approach. The surgical outcome in eight patients was excellent; in the remaining six patients, it was fair. Of the prognostic factors, tumor location especially seemed to be the most important (p {\textless} 0.01, Fisher exact test). The outcome associated with the inferior type of tumor was significantly less optimal probably due to the relationship to the deep veins and the brainstem. In this series, the occlusion of deep veins did not significantly influence outcome. CONCLUSIONS:. Classification of the tumor location by preoperative neuroimaging studies can be helpful in estimating the surgical difficulty that might be encountered in treating the falcotentorial junction meningioma.},

abstract = {Significant gaps exist in our understanding of the causes and clinical management of glioma. One of the biggest gaps is how best to manage low-grade (World Health Organization [WHO] Grade II) glioma. Low-grade glioma (LGG) is a uniformly fatal disease of young adults (mean age 41 years), with survival averaging approximately 7 years. Although LGG patients have better survival than patients with high-grade (WHO Grade III or IV) glioma, all LGGs eventually progress to high-grade glioma and death. Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program of the National Cancer Institute suggest that for the majority of LGG patients, overall survival has not significantly improved over the past 3 decades, highlighting the need for intensified study of this tumor. Recently published research suggests that historically used clinical variables are not sufficient (and are likely inferior) prognostic and predictive indicators relative to information provided by recently discovered tumor markers (e.g., 1p/19q deletion and IDH1 or IDH2 mutation status), tumor expression profiles (e.g., the proneural profile) and/or constitutive genotype (e.g., rs55705857 on 8q24.21). Discovery of such tumor and constitutive variation may identify variables needed to improve randomization in clinical trials as well as identify patients more sensitive to current treatments and targets for improved treatment in the future. This article reports on survival trends for patients diagnosed with LGG within the United States from 1973 through 2011 and reviews the emerging role of tumor and constitutive genetics in refining risk stratification, defining targeted therapy, and improving survival for this group of relatively young patients.},

abstract = {Objective: To assess the effect of high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on lower extremities motor score (LEMS) and gait in patients with motor incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI). Method: The prospective longitudinal randomized, double-blind study assessed 17 SCI patients ASIA D. We assessed LEMS, modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), 10-m walking test (10MWT), Walking Index for SCI (WISCI II) scale, step length, cadence, and Timed Up and Go (TUG) test at baseline, after the last of 15 daily sessions of rTMS and 2 weeks later. Patients were randomized to active rTMS or sham stimulation. Three patients from the initial group of 10 randomized to sham stimulation entered the active rTMS group after a 3-week washout period. Therefore a total of 10 patients completed each study condition. Both groups were homogeneous for age, gender, time since injury, etiology, and ASIA scale. Active rTMS consisted of 15 days of daily sessions of 20 trains of 40 pulses at 20 Hz and an intensity of 90{\%} of resting motor threshold. rTMS was applied with a double cone coil to the leg motor area. Results: There was a significant improvement in LEMS in the active group (28.4 at baseline and 33.2 after stimulation; P = .004) but not in the sham group (29.6 at baseline, and 30.9 after stimulation; P = .6). The active group also showed significant improvements in the MAS, 10MWT, cadence, step length, and TUG, and these improvements were maintained 2 weeks later. Following sham stimulation, significant improvement was found only for step length and TUG. No significant changes were observed in the WISCI II scale in either group. Conclusion: High-frequency rTMS over the leg motor area can improve LEMS, spasticity, and gait in patients with motor incomplete SCI. {\textcopyright} 2012 Thomas Land Publishers, Inc.},

abstract = {The long-term results obtained in a series of 174 patients operated on for spinal meningiomas are critically analyzed. This series was similar to those of other authors with regard to age, sex, location of the tumors, and clinical presentation. Before surgery, about 70{\%} of the patients were included in Groups I and II (mild neurological impairment), and about 30{\%} of the patients were classified in Groups III and IV (significant to severe neurological impairment, up to paraplegia). Complete tumor removal was achieved in 96.5{\%} of the patients, and surgical mortality was about 1{\%}. Microsurgical technique, which was adopted in the last 29 cases, proved to be very effective in reducing undue damage to the spinal cord and in minimizing the postoperative neurological deficits. Of the 174 patients who underwent surgery, 156 underwent late follow-up study for an average of 15 years (2 patients died in the immediate postoperative period, and 16 patients were lost to follow-up). Twenty-nine patients died of causes unrelated to the spinal meningioma; of the remaining 126 patients, 92{\%} were categorized in Groups I and II, and only 8{\%} in Groups III and IV. The rate of recurrence was 6{\%} (9 patients) among the 150 patients who had complete tumor removal, and the rate of regrowth was 17{\%} (1 patient with anaplastic meningioma) among the 6 patients treated by subtotal removal. The early diagnosis of the disease and the use of microsurgical technique appeared as the most relevant factors for further improvement of the surgical results.},

abstract = {Background: An anterior sacral meningocele is a rare form of spinal dysraphism that is sometimes associated with syndromes such as Currarino and Marfan syndromes. These lesions rarely cause neurological complications, but meningitis, sepsis, obstetric problems, and bowel and bladder difficulties are common secondary conditions. The lesions can even be fatal. Because these lesions usually do not regress spontaneously, surgical treatment is the standard for symptomatic or growing masses. The dural defect can be repaired with a variety of anterior or posterior approaches. Case Description: We present a case of a 16-year-old female patient with a giant nonsyndromic anterior sacral meningocele that we successfully treated using an open anterior approach. We discuss the treatment options and present a brief review of the literature. Conclusions: Although the posterior approach remains the treatment of choice for most lesions, we believe that the anterior laparotomy provides excellent exposure and is a safe alternative approach for the treatment of selected lesions. Patients with these lesions should be cared for by a multidisciplinary team. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Objective The physiological mechanisms underlying the recovery of motor function after cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) surgery are poorly understood. Neuronal plasticity allows neurons to compensate for injury and disease and to adjust their activities in response to new situations or changes in their environment. Cortical reorganization as well as improvement in corticospinal conduction happens during motor recovery after stroke and spinal cord injury. In this study the authors aimed to understand the cortical changes that occur due to CSM and following CSM surgery and to correlate these changes with functional recovery by using blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI). Methods Twenty-two patients having symptoms related to cervical cord compression due to spondylotic changes along with 12 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were included in this study. Patients underwent cervical spine MRI and BOLD fMRI at 1 month before surgery (baseline) and 6 months after surgery. Results Five patients were excluded from analysis because of technical problems; thus, 17 patients made up the study cohort. The mean overall modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association score improved in patients following surgery. Mean upper-extremity, lower-extremity, and sensory scores improved significantly. In the preoperative patient group the volume of activation (VOA) was significantly higher than that in controls. The VOA after surgery was reduced as compared with that before surgery, although it remained higher than that in the control group. In the preoperative patient group, activations were noted only in the left precentral gyrus (PrCG). In the postoperative group, activations were seen in the left postcentral gyrus (PoCG), as well as the PrCG and premotor and supplementary motor cortices. In postoperative group, the VOA was higher in both the PrCG and PoCG as compared with those in the control group. Conc lusions There is over-recruitment of sensorimotor cortices during nondexterous relative to dexterous movements before surgery. After surgery, there was recruitment of other cortical areas such as the PoCG and premotor and supplementary motor cortices, which correlated with improvement in dexterity, but activation in these areas was greater than that found in controls. The results show that improvement in dexterity and finer movements of the upper limbs is associated with recruitment areas other than the premotor cortex to compensate for the damage in the cervical spinal cord.},

abstract = {First lines: TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY (TBI) is a major cause of disability, death, and economic cost to our society. One of the central concepts that emerged from research is that all neurological damage from TBI does not occur at the moment of impact, but evolves over the ensuing hours and days. Furthermore, improved outcome results when these secondary, delayed insults, resulting in reduced cerebral perfusion to the injured brain, are prevented or respond to treatment. This is reflected in the progressive and significant reduction in severe TBI mortality from 50{\%} to 35{\%} to 25{\%} and lower over the last 30 years, even when adjusted for injury severity, age and other admission prognostic parameters.1 This trend in reduced mortality and improved outcomes from TBI has been subsequent to the use of evidence-based protocols that emphasize monitoring and maintaining adequate cerebral perfusion.2,3},

abstract = {The rationale and the surgical technique of stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG)–guided radiofrequency thermocoagulation (RF-TC) in the epileptogenic zone (EZ) of patients with difficult-to-treat focal epilepsy are described in this article. The application of the technique in pediatric patients is also detailed. Stereotactic ablative procedures by RF-TC have been employed in the treatment of epilepsy since the middle of the last century. This treatment option has gained new popularity in recent decades, mainly because of the availability of modern imaging techniques, which allow accurate targeting of intracerebral epileptogenic structures. SEEG is a powerful tool for identifying theEZin the most challenging cases of focal epilepsy by recording electrical activity with tailored stereotactic implantation of multilead intracerebral electrodes. The same recording electrodes may be used to place thermocoagulative lesions in the EZ, following the indications provided by intracerebral monitoring. The technical details of SEEG implantation and of SEEG-guided RF-TC are described herein, with special attention to the employment of the procedure in pediatric cases. SEEG-guided RF-TC offers a potential therapeutic option based on robust electroclinical evidence with acceptable risks and costs. The procedure may be performed in patients who, according to SEEG recording, are not eligible for resective surgery, and it may be an alternative to resective surgery in a small subset of operable patients.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Springer-Verlag Berlin HeidelbergPurpose: We aimed to determine cut-offs between mild, moderate and severe myelopathy on the modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) score. Methods: Between December 2005 and January 2011, 757 patients with clinically diagnosed DCM were enrolled in the prospective AOSpine North America (n = 278) or International (n = 479) study at 26 sites. Functional status and quality of life were evaluated at baseline using a variety of outcome measures. Using the Nurick score as an anchor, receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis was conducted to determine cut-offs between mild, moderate and severe disease. The validity of the identified cut-offs was evaluated by examining whether patients in different severity groups differed in terms of impairment, disability, quality of life and number of signs and symptoms. Results: A mJOA of 14 was determined to be the cut-off between mild and moderate myelopathy and a mJOA of 11 was the cut-off score between moderate and severe disease. Patients in the severe myelopathy group (n = 254) had significantly reduced quality of life and functional status and a greater number of signs and symptoms compared to patients classified as mild (n = 190) or moderate (n = 296). Conclusions: Mild myelopathy can be defined as mJOA from 15 to 17, moderate as mJOA from 12 to 14 and severe as mJOA from 0 to 11. These categories should be adopted worldwide to standardize clinical assessment of DCM.},

abstract = {Spinal cord injury can produce extensive long-term reorganization of the cerebral cortex. Little is known, however, about the sequence of cortical events starting immediately after the lesion. Here we show that a complete thoracic transection of the spinal cord produces immediate functional reorganization in the primary somatosensory cortex of anesthetized rats. Besides the obvious loss of cortical responses to hindpaw stimuli (below the level of the lesion), cortical responses evoked by forepaw stimuli (above the level of the lesion) markedly increase. Importantly, these increased responses correlate with a slower and overall more silent cortical spontaneous activity, representing a switch to a network state of slow-wave activity similar to that observed during slow-wave sleep. The same immediate cortical changes are observed after reversible pharmacological block of spinal cord conduction, but not after sham. We conclude that the deafferentation due to spinal cord injury can immediately (within minutes) change the state of large cortical networks, and that this state change plays a critical role in the early cortical reorganization after spinal cord injury.},

Age ranged from 17 to 88 years (mean 69 years). The mean follow-up period was 61 months (range 1-116 months) including a complete neurological examination and postoperative MRI studies. The pre- and postoperative neurological state was graded according to the Frankel Scale. Surgery was performed under standard microsurgical conditions with neurophysiological monitoring. In 73{\%} the lesion was located in the thoracic region, in 16{\%} in the cervical region, in 5{\%} at the cervico-thoracic junction, in 4.5{\%} at the thoraco-lumbar junction and in 1.5{\%} in the lumbar region. Surgical resection was complete in 127 patients (97{\%}) and incomplete in 4 patients (3{\%}). At the last follow-up the neurological state was improved or unchanged in 126 patients (96.2{\%}) and worse in 4 patients (3{\%}).

The aim of this analysis is to assess the current evidence regarding safety and efficiency of clipping compared with coiling.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis of studies that compared clipping with coiling between January 1999 and July 2012. Comparison of binary outcomes between treatment groups was described using odds ratios (OR; clip versus coil).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Four randomized controlled trials and 23 observational studies were included. Randomized controlled trials showed that coiling reduced the 1-year unfavorable outcome rate (OR, 1.48; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.24-1.76). However, there was no statistical deference in nonrandomized controlled trials (OR, 1.11; 95{\%} CI, 0.96-1.28). Subgroup analysis revealed coiling yielded better outcomes for patients with good preoperative grade (OR, 1.51; 95{\%} CI, 1.24-1.84) than for poor preoperative patients (OR, 0.88; 95{\%} CI 0.56-1.38). Additionally, the incidence of rebleeding is higher after coiling (OR, 0.43; 95{\%} CI, 0.28-0.66), corresponding to a better complete occlusion rate of clipping (OR, 2.43; 95{\%} CI, 1.88-3.13). The 1-year mortality showed no significant difference (OR, 1.07; 95{\%} CI, 0.88-1.30). Vasospasm was more common after clipping (OR, 1.43; 95{\%} CI, 1.07-1.91), whereas the ischemic infarct (OR, 0.74; 95{\%} CI, 0.52-1.06), shunt-dependent hydrocephalus (OR, 0.84; 95{\%} CI, 0.66-1.07), and procedural complication rates (OR, 1.19; 95{\%} CI, 0.67-2.11) did not differ significantly between techniques.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Coiling yields a better clinical outcome, the benefit being greater in those with a good preoperative grade than those with a poor preoperative grade.

abstract = {OBJECT: The authors provide a detailed review of the surgical management of trigeminal schwannomas (TSs) and also discuss the best surgical approach based on the surgical anatomy and tumor extension. METHODS: A series of 17 patients with TSs who were surgically treated between 1987 and 2008 at the authors' institution is reported. The lesions were small ({\textless} 3 cm) in 2, medium (between 3 and 4 cm) in 5, large ({\textgreater} 4 cm) in 6, and giant ({\textgreater} 5 cm) in 4 cases. Preoperative symptoms included trigeminal hypesthesia (53{\%}), facial pain (53{\%}), headaches (35.3{\%}), hearing impairment (17.6{\%}), seizures (17.6{\%}), diplopia (11.8{\%}), ataxia (11.8{\%}), and hemiparesis and increased intracranial pressure with papilledema (5.9{\%}). The mean follow-up duration was 10.5 years (121.6 months), with an average of 0.8 patients per year. RESULTS: Total tumor excision was possible in 16 patients, with no surgery-related deaths. Postoperative trigeminal anesthesia was observed in 7; trigeminal motor function was preserved in 7. Two developed cerebrospinal fluid leakage, 2 presented with mild facial palsy, and 1 patient with neurofibromatosis Type 2 had recurrence of the tumor, which was uneventfully removed. Of the 9 who reported facial pain, only 1 remained symptomatic postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: The best treatment for TSs is complete microsurgical removal. Postoperative preservation of trigeminal nerve function is possible when resection of the lesion is performed at well-established skull base neurosurgical centers.

abstract = {AIM: Surgery for tumors in the central and precentral region, as much as for insular tumors, places at risk the functional integrity of the motor cortex and the subcortical motor pathways. These procedures may therefore benefit from the assistance of intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (INM). INM consists of "mapping" and true "monitoring" (the continuous "on-line" assessment of the functional integrity of neural pathways) techniques. In spite of the large interest in mapping techniques, monitoring techniques have received less attention. We describe our experience with intraoperative neurophysiological mapping and monitoring of motor tracts during surgery for brain gliomas in or near motor areas, in order to support the feasibility and reliability of monitoring as an essential adjunct to mapping during surgery in these areas. METHODS: Between September 2000 and January 2002, 51 patients were surgically treated for brain gliomas located in the precentral gyrus (45.1{\%}), the postcentral gyrus (23.5{\%}), anterior to the precentral gyrus (15.6{\%}), or in the insula (15.6{\%}). INM of the motor system consisted of monitoring muscle motor evoked potentials (mMEPs) recorded via needle electrodes inserted into the controlateral upper and lower extremity muscles and elicited by transcranial multipulse electrical stimulation (TES). Once the dura was open and the central sulcus was identified using the phase reversal technique, mMEPs were elicited by direct stimulation of the motor cortex (DCS). Motor mapping was performed with a monopolar electrode using the same stimulation parameters as used for monitoring except for much lower intensity (up to 20 mA). RESULTS: Ninety-eight percent of the patients exhibited recordable baseline mMEPs. The success rate of the phase reversal technique was 95.8{\%}. Eight patients presented disappearance of mMEPs during tumor removal. Using corrective measures, all intraoperative changes in mMEPs were reversed in time to prevent an irreversible complete injury to the motor system and no patient lost mMEPs at the end of the operation. At discharge, 66{\%} of the patients remained at their preoperative status, 4{\%} improved, and 24{\%} had a mild worsening as compared to the preoperative status assessed using the Medical Research Council scale; 6{\%} of the patients presented a moderate to severe supplementary motor area syndrome. CONCLUSION: Monitoring techniques significantly implement the reliability and effectiveness of INM since these provide: 1) continuous "on-line" assessment of the functional integrity of motor pathways with higher chance to early detect a progressive mechanical or vascular injury to the neural tissue, as compared to mapping techniques; 2) lower risk to induce intraoperative seizures and strong muscular twitches as compared to the single pulse mapping technique; 3) possibility to monitor motor pathways using TES also when there is no direct access to the motor cortex.},

abstract = {OBJECT: Anterior sacral meningocele (ASM) is a rare congenital malformation. Often while still asymptomatic, ASM may achieve a considerably size, to the extent of exerting a mass effect on the pelvic structures. Spontaneous rupture with subsequent septic meningitis is the most frequent and dangerous complication. The meningocelic sac is usually isolated by a surgical procedure that requires a sacral laminectomy or a transabdominal approach. Recently an alternative surgical technique, the posterior sagittal approach, has been proposed. METHODS: We report on a 15-year-old girl with a long clinical history of constipation and sporadic cystitis. Radiological examinations showed progressive enlargement of a presacral lipomeningocele, which grew to 12x14 cm. A posterior sagittal approach was performed; the stalk was ligated, the sac totally excised and a small associated tumour removed. No intra-/post-operative complications were observed. CONCLUSION: The posterior sagittal approach is an easy and safe surgical technique for the treatment of ASM, as it allows a complete isolation of the lesion and the removal of associated tumors without significant morbidity.},

Early epilepsy sur-gery is the treatment of choice in most of these patients, but conventional resective surgery carries substantial op-erative risks. Similar to the continuous evolution of disconnective techniques in functional hemispherectomy, the surgical approach for TPO epilepsies has evolved progressively toward more disconnection and less resection. 5,6,18,20,21 Disconnective procedures are based on the concept that interrupting the epileptic discharge–spreading path-way and isolating the primary epileptogenic zone would have the same effect as removing the epileptic focus. The potential benefits of this approach include smaller crani-otomies, reduced blood loss, and fewer long-term compli- Object. Outcomes following functional hemispherotomy in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy have been well described. However, studies reporting long-term longitudinal outcomes after subhemispheric disconnective epilepsy surgery are still limited. Methods. The authors conducted a retrospective review of prospectively collected data of 10 children who un-derwent temporoparietooccipital (TPO) disconnective surgery at the Vienna Pediatric Epilepsy Center. Results. There were 3 males and 7 females (median age 8.7 years; range 4.2–22.1 years). The affected hemi-sphere was the left in 3 patients and the right in 7. The patients' median age at seizure onset was 3.0 years (range 0.2–8.3 years). The median duration of epilepsy before surgery was 5.2 years (range 1.3–17.2 years). The underlying pathology was TPO malformation of cortical development in 5 patients, and venous infarction, posterior hemispheric quadrant atrophy, Sturge-Weber syndrome, cortical involvement of a systemic lupus erythematosus, and gliosis after cerebral tumor treatment in 1 each. In 6 children, a pure TPO disconnection was performed; in 2 patients, the tempo-ral lobe was resected and parietooccipital disconnection was performed. The 2 remaining patients had had previous epilepsy surgery that was extended to a TPO disconnection: disconnection of the occipital lobe (n = 1) and resection of the temporal lobe (n = 1). The authors encountered no complications while performing surgery. No patient needed blood replacement therapy. No patient developed CSF disturbances that warranted treatment. Nine of 10 patients are currently seizure free since surgery (Wieser Class 1a) at a median follow-up time of 2.1 years (range 4 months to 8.1 years). Conclusions. Temporoparietooccipital disconnection is a safe and effective motor-sparing epilepsy surgery in selected cases. Technical adjuncts facilitate a better intraoperative visualization and orientation, thereby enabling a less invasive approach than previously suggested.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Massachusetts Medical Society. BACKGROUND The efficacy of fusion surgery in addition to decompression surgery in patients who have lumbar spinal stenosis, with or without degenerative spondylolisthesis, has not been substantiated in controlled trials. METHODS We randomly assigned 247 patients between 50 and 80 years of age who had lumbar spinal stenosis at one or two adjacent vertebral levels to undergo either decompression surgery plus fusion surgery (fusion group) or decompression surgery alone (decompression-alone group). Randomization was stratified according to the presence of preoperative degenerative spondylolisthesis (in 135 patients) or its absence. Outcomes were assessed with the use of patient- reported outcome measures, a 6-minute walk test, and a health economic evaluation. The primary outcome was the score on the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI; which ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more severe disability) 2 years after surgery. The primary analysis, which was a per-protocol analysis, did not include the 14 patients who did not receive the assigned treatment and the 5 who were lost to follow-up. RESULTS There was no significant difference between the groups in the mean score on the ODI at 2 years (27 in the fusion group and 24 in the decompression-alone group, P = 0.24) or in the results of the 6-minute walk test (397 m in the fusion group and 405 m in the decompression- Alone group, P = 0.72). Results were similar between patients with and those without spondylolisthesis. Among the patients who had 5 years of follow-up and were eligible for inclusion in the 5-year analysis, there were no significant differences between the groups in clinical outcomes at 5 years. The mean length of hospitalization was 7.4 days in the fusion group and 4.1 days in the decompression-alone group (P{\textless}0.001). Operating time was longer, the amount of bleeding was greater, and surgical costs were higher in the fusion group than in the decompression-alone group. During a mean follow-up of 6.5 years, additional lumbar spine surgery was performed in 22{\%} of the patients in the fusion group and in 21{\%} of those in the decompression-alone group. CONCLUSIONS Among patients with lumbar spinal stenosis, with or without degenerative spondylolisthesis, decompression surgery plus fusion surgery did not result in better clinical outcomes at 2 years and 5 years than did decompression surgery alone.

The risk of recurrence is estimated to be very low, except with subtotal resections. This retrospective study was designed to establish the course of illness, clinical outcome, and recurrence rate of benign spinal tumours. We present an overview of the clinical outcome and surgical treatment of 197 benign spinal tumours carried out in our centre from 1980 to 1999. Clinical history, signs, surgical approach, outcome, and radiological reports were obtained by reviewing patient charts. The most frequent benign tumour was meningeoma (41{\%}), closely followed by neurinoma (33{\%}) and neurofibroma (6.1{\%}). Of all tumours, 79.7{\%} were completely resected. Recurrence happened in 10.2{\%} on an average of 4.3 years postoperatively. Only 2 patients suffered from neurofibromatosis. All neurinomas were completely resected at first operation, whereas three out of seven recurrent meningeomas and all ependymomas were classified as subtotally resected. Seventy per cent were treated by repeated surgical intervention. Benign tumours usually can be completely removed without adding to patients' neurological deficits. Benign tumours recur in 10.2{\%} of cases, thus requiring long-term follow-up. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies are recommended up to 5 years postoperatively as a routine procedure.},

Given the combination of these imaging findings and a severe headache, the patients are often confused to have a primary subarachnoid hemorrhage. Case Report . We present a patient with spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) who had an incidental ophthalmic artery aneurysm on MR imaging, and this presentation led to coiling of the aneurysm. The key aspect in the history “postural headaches” was missed, and this led to life threatening complications and unnecessary interventions. Revisiting the history and significant improvement in symptoms following an epidural blood patch resulted in the diagnosis of SIH. Conclusion . We strongly emphasize that appropriate history taking is the key in the diagnosis of SIH and providing timely treatment with an epidural blood patch could prevent potentially life threatening complications.},

abstract = {Treatment paradigms for patients with spine metastases have evolved significantly over the past decade. Incorporating stereotactic radiosurgery into these paradigms has been particularly transformative, offering precise delivery of tumoricidal radiation doses with sparing of adjacent tissues. Evidence supports the safety and efficacy of radiosurgery as it currently offers durable local tumor control with low complication rates even for tumors previously considered radioresistant to conventional radiation. The role for surgical intervention remains consistent, but a trend has been observed toward less aggressive, often minimally invasive, techniques. Using modern technologies and improved instrumentation, surgical outcomes continue to improve with reduced morbidity. Additionally, targeted agents such as biologics and checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized cancer care, improving both local control and patient survivals. These advances have brought forth a need for new prognostication tools and a more critical review of long-term outcomes. The complex nature of current treatment schemes necessitates a multidisciplinary approach including surgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, interventionalists, and pain specialists. This review recapitulates the current state-of-the-art, evidence-based data on the treatment of spinal metastases, integrating these data into a decision framework, NOMS, which integrates the 4 sentinel decision points in metastatic spine tumors: Neurologic, Oncologic, Mechanical stability, and Systemic disease and medical co-morbidities.},

abstract = {OBJECT: Spontaneous intracranial hypotension is a noteworthy but commonly misdiagnosed cause of new daily persistent headaches. Subdural fluid collections are frequent radiographic findings, but they can be interpreted as primary rather than secondary pathological entities, and uncertainties exist regarding their optimal management. The authors therefore reviewed their experience with subdural fluid collections in 40 consecutive patients with spontaneous spinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks and intracranial hypotension. METHODS: The mean age of the 26 female and 14 male patients was 43 years (range 13-72 years). Subdural fluid collections were present in 20 patients (50{\%}); 12 of these patients (60{\%}) had subdural hygromas alone, and eight (40{\%}) had subacute to chronic subdural hematomas (SDHs) associated with significant mass effect. The subdural hygromas resolved within several days to weeks following treatment of the underlying CSF leak. Three patients with SDHs underwent evacuation of the hematoma prior to the establishment of the diagnosis of spontaneous intracranial hypotension, but the SDHs did not resolve until the underlying spinal CSF leak was treated. In the remaining five patients, the CSF leak was treated primarily and the SDHs resolved over a 1- to 3-month period without the need for evacuation. CONCLUSIONS: Subdural fluid collections are common in spontaneous intracranial hypotension, varying in appearance from thin subdural hygromas to large SDHs associated with significant mass effect. These collections can be safely managed by directing treatment at the underlying CSF leak without the need for hematoma evacuation.},

In addition, tractography analysis of the uncinate fasciculus, a tract associated with semantic processing deficits, was performed. Damage to the frontal aslant tract correlated with performance in verbal fluency as assessed by the Cinderella story test. Conversely, damage to the uncinate fasciculus correlated with deficits in semantic processing as assessed by the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test. Neither tract correlated with grammatical or repetition deficits. Significant group differences were found in the frontal aslant tract of patients with the non-fluent/agrammatic variant and in the uncinate fasciculus of patients with the semantic variant. These findings indicate that degeneration of the frontal aslant tract underlies verbal fluency deficits in primary progressive aphasia and further confirm the role of the uncinate fasciculus in semantic processing. The lack of correlation between damage to the frontal aslant tract and grammar deficits suggests that verbal fluency and grammar processing rely on distinct anatomical networks.},

The MRI appearance was also suggestive of SIH, with diffuse meningeal enhancement. Treatment with autologous blood injection at the level of the radionuclide spinal leakage was useful, resulting in disappearance of SIH symptoms.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this guideline is to present current and comprehensive recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. METHODS: A formal literature search of PubMed was performed through the end of August 2013. The writing committee met by teleconference to discuss narrative text and recommendations. Recommendations follow the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association methods of classifying the level of certainty of the treatment effect and the class of evidence. Prerelease review of the draft guideline was performed by 6 expert peer reviewers and by the members of the Stroke Council Scientific Oversight Committee and Stroke Council Leadership Committee. RESULTS: Evidence-based guidelines are presented for the care of patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage. Topics focused on diagnosis, management of coagulopathy and blood pressure, prevention and control of secondary brain injury and intracranial pressure, the role of surgery, outcome prediction, rehabilitation, secondary prevention, and future considerations. Results of new phase 3 trials were incorporated. CONCLUSIONS: Intracerebral hemorrhage remains a serious condition for which early aggressive care is warranted. These guidelines provide a framework for goal-directed treatment of the patient with intracerebral hemorrhage.},

abstract = {Background and importance: Spinal cord compression may induce cortical reorganization. This study follows a patient with cervical spondylotic myelopathy to investigate changes in cortical activation before and after decompressive surgery. The relationship with functional recovery is also described. Clinical presentation: A 37-year-old right-hand-dominant man presented a 1-month history of rapidly worsening right-hand clumsiness, right-sided hemiparesis, and gait difficulties. Physical examination confirmed severe right-sided weakness, impaired dexterity, hyperreflexia, and wide-based gait. The patient underwent blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging at 4 T. Images were obtained before and 6 months after an anterior cervical discectomy with insertion of an artificial disk. Blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to detect changes in cortical activation over time during a finger-tapping (motor) paradigm. Improvement in clinical function was recorded with validated clinical tools, including the Japanese Orthopedic Association scale for cervical spondylotic myelopathy, the Nurick neurological function score, and the Neck Disability Index, along with clinical examination. Conclusion: After decompressive cervical spine surgery in a patient with cervical spondylotic myelopathy, functional magnetic resonance imaging detected increased cortical activation in the primary motor cortex during finger tapping. These changes occurred concomitantly with improvement in motor function. Upper-and lower-extremity motor subscores of the Japanese Orthopedic Association scale demonstrated 40{\%} and 43{\%} improvement, respectively. These observations suggest that cortical reorganization or recruitment may accompany the recovery of function after spinal cord injury. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Cerebrospinal fluid hypovolemia resulting in postural headaches is a well-known clinical entity, but severe forms of cerebrospinal fluid hypovolemia with altered mental status and signs of transtentorial herniation ("brain sag") have rarely been reported. This article describes the clinical features of brain sag after craniotomy in an attempt to increase recognition of this syndrome. METHODS: Between April 2001 and January 2003, 220 consecutive patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage were prospectively enrolled in the Columbia Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Outcomes Project; 137 underwent craniotomy for aneurysm clipping. Among these patients, the diagnosis of brain sag was made when all three of the following criteria were present: clinical signs of transtentorial herniation, head computed tomographic scans revealing effacement of the basal cisterns with an oblong brainstem, and improvement of symptoms after placement of the patient in the Trendelenburg position (-15 to -30 degrees). For each patient, the symptoms, clinical course, and subsequent response to treatment were characterized. In addition, brainstem dimensions were measured on computed tomographic scans taken before, during, and after resolution of brain sag. A "sag ratio" was generated for these time points by dividing the maximum anteroposterior distance by the maximum bipeduncular distance. RESULTS: Eleven (8.0{\%}) of 137 aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients treated by craniotomy and an intraoperative spinal drain met the criteria for brain sag. Signs of transtentorial herniation developed most commonly between 2 and 4 days postoperatively. Pupillary asymmetry was noted in 10 (91.0{\%}) of 11 patients, whereas the other patient demonstrated extensor posturing. The Trendelenburg position reversed the symptoms in all patients. The mean sag ratios before, during, and after resolution of brain sag were 0.91 +/- 0.03 (mean +/- standard error), 1.18 +/- 0.03, and 0.91 +/- 0.03, respectively. This represented a 30.9{\%} elongation of the brainstem during sag (P {\textless} 0.001) and a 23.6{\%} change back to baseline after resolution of the syndrome (P {\textless} 0.002). There was no significant difference between the presag and postsag ratios. CONCLUSION: Severe cerebrospinal fluid hypovolemia after craniotomy may produce a dramatic herniation syndrome that is completely reversed by the Trendelenburg position. Brain sag should be included in the differential diagnosis for acute postoperative clinical deterioration in this patient population.},

abstract = {Epileptogenic networks are defined by the brain regions involved in the production and propagation of epileptic activities. In this review we describe the historical, methodologic, and conceptual bases of this model in the analysis of electrophysiologic intracerebral recordings. In the context of epilepsy surgery, the determination of cerebral regions producing seizures (i.e., the “epileptogenic zone”) is a crucial objec- tive. In contrast with a traditional focal vision of focal drug-resistant epilepsies, the concept of epileptogenic networks has been progressively introduced as a model bet- ter able to describe the complexity of seizure dynamics and realistically describe the distribution of epileptogenic anomalies in the brain. The concept of epileptogenic networks is historically linked to the development of the stereoelectroencephalogra- phy (SEEG) method and subsequent introduction of means of quantifying the recorded signals. Seizures, and preictal and interictal discharges produce clear pat- terns on SEEG. These patterns can be analyzed utilizing signal analysis methods that quantify high-frequency oscillations or changes in functional connectivity. Dramatic changes in SEEG brain connectivity can be described during seizure genesis and prop- agation within cortical and subcortical regions, associated with the production of dif- ferent patterns of seizure semiology. The interictal state is characterized by networks generating abnormal activities (interictal spikes) and also by modified func- tional properties. The introduction of novel approaches to large-scale modeling of these networks offers new methods in the goal of better predicting the effects of epi- lepsy surgery. The epileptogenic network concept is a key factor in identifying the anatomic distribution of the epileptogenic process, which is particularly important in the context of epilepsy surgery.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Early decompressive hemicraniectomy reduces mortality without increasing the risk of very severe disability among patients 60 years of age or younger with complete or subtotal space-occupying middle-cerebral-artery infarction. Its benefit in older patients is uncertain. METHODS: We randomly assigned 112 patients 61 years of age or older (median, 70 years; range, 61 to 82) with malignant middle-cerebral-artery infarction to either conservative treatment in the intensive care unit (the control group) or hemicraniectomy (the hemicraniectomy group); assignments were made within 48 hours after the onset of symptoms. The primary end point was survival without severe disability (defined by a score of 0 to 4 on the modified Rankin scale, which ranges from 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]) 6 months after randomization. RESULTS: Hemicraniectomy improved the primary outcome; the proportion of patients who survived without severe disability was 38{\%} in the hemicraniectomy group, as compared with 18{\%} in the control group (odds ratio, 2.91; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.06 to 7.49; P=0.04). This difference resulted from lower mortality in the surgery group (33{\%} vs. 70{\%}). No patients had a modified Rankin scale score of 0 to 2 (survival with no disability or slight disability); 7{\%} of patients in the surgery group and 3{\%} of patients in the control group had a score of 3 (moderate disability); 32{\%} and 15{\%}, respectively, had a score of 4 (moderately severe disability [requirement for assistance with most bodily needs]); and 28{\%} and 13{\%}, respectively, had a score of 5 (severe disability). Infections were more frequent in the hemicraniectomy group, and herniation was more frequent in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Hemicraniectomy increased survival without severe disability among patients 61 years of age or older with a malignant middle-cerebral-artery infarction. The majority of survivors required assistance with most bodily needs. (Funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; DESTINY II Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN21702227.).},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Springer-Verlag Wien. Introduction: Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) is increasingly used for preoperative mapping of motor function, and clinical evidence for its benefit for brain tumor patients is accumulating. In respect to language mapping with repetitive nTMS, literature reports have yielded variable results, and it is currently not routinely performed for presurgical language localization. The aim of this project is to define a common protocol for nTMS motor and language mapping to standardize its neurosurgical application and increase its clinical value. Methods: The nTMS workshop group, consisting of highly experienced nTMS users with experience of more than 1500 preoperative nTMS examinations, met in Helsinki in January 2016 for thorough discussions of current evidence and personal experiences with the goal to recommend a standardized protocol for neurosurgical applications. Results: nTMS motor mapping is a reliable and clinically validated tool to identify functional areas belonging to both normal and lesioned primary motor cortex. In contrast, this is less clear for language-eloquent cortical areas identified by nTMS. The user group agreed on a core protocol, which enables comparison of results between centers and has an excellent safety profile. Recommendations for nTMS motor and language mapping protocols and their optimal clinical integration are presented here. Conclusion: At present, the expert panel recommends nTMS motor mapping in routine neurosurgical practice, as it has a sufficient level of evidence supporting its reliability. The panel recommends that nTMS language mapping be used in the framework of clinical studies to continue refinement of its protocol and increase reliability.},

abstract = {Objective: To explore plasticity in patients scheduled for extra-intracranial bypass surgery due to unilateral symptomatic occlusive cerebrovascular disease via navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation. Methods: In this observational study patients were allocated to different sub-studies and examined before and 3 months after operation. A) Corticospinal excitability was determined via identification of the resting motor threshold. B) Intracortical inhibition and facilitation were tested by paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation. C) Area of cortical representation of the first dorsal interosseous muscle was identified. Results: A) Resting motor thresholds were higher in the affected hemispheres (AH) with impaired cerebrovascular reserve capacity compared to the unaffected hemispheres (UH) (45.7 ± 2.2{\%} compared to 39.2 ± 1.4{\%}, n=39, p{\textless}0.05). Reduced excitability normalized 3 months after revascularization (51 ± 2.6{\%} → 45 ± 1.9{\%}, n=21, p{\textless}0.05). B) In paired pulse paradigms, there was a motor disinhibition in the operated hemispheres. C) There was a reduction of the cortical representation areas of the first dorsal interosseous muscle (2.3 ± 0.5cm2 → 0.9 ± 0.6cm2, n=9, p {\textless}0.05) after operation. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate a reversibly impaired motorcortical function in the chronically ischemic brain. In carefully selected patients cerebral revascularization leads to improved motor output indicated by a lower resting motor threshold, intracortical disinhibition, and more focused motorcortical representation.},

abstract = {Pedicle screw fixation has achieved significant popularity amongst spinal surgeons for both single and multi-level spinal fusion. Misplacement and pedicle cortical violation occurs in over 20{\{}{\%}{\}} of screw placement and can result in potential complications such as dysthesia, paraparesis or paraplegia. There have been many advances in techniques available for navigating through the pedicle; however, these techniques are not without drawbacks. A new electrical conductivity-measuring device, previously evaluated on the porcine model to detect the pedicle violation, was evaluated amongst nine European Hospitals to be used in conjunction with the methods currently used in that centre. This new device is based on two original principles; the device is integrated in the drilling or screwing tool. The technology allows real-time detection of perforation through two independent parameters, impedance variation and evoked muscle contractions. Data was collected twofold. Initially, the surgeon was given the device and a comparison was made between the devices ability to detect a breech and the surgeon's ability to detect one using his traditional methods of pedicle preparation. In the second module of the study, the surgeon was limited to using the electrical conductivity detection device as their sole guide to detect pedicle breaches. A comparison was made between the detection ability of the device and the other detection possibilities. Post-operative fine cut CT scanning was used to detect the pedicle breaches. Overall, the 11 trial surgeons performed a total of 521 pedicle drillings on 97 patients. Initially there were 147 drillings with 23 breaches detected. The detection rate of these breaches were 22/23 for the device compared to 10/23 by the surgeon. Over both parts of the study 64 breaches (12.3{\{}{\%}{\}}) were confirmed on post-operative CT imaging. The electrical conductivity detection device detected 63 of the 64 breaches (98.4{\{}{\%}{\}}). There was one false negative and four false positives. This gives the device an overall sensitivity of 98{\{}{\%}{\}} and specificity of 99{\{}{\%}{\}} for detecting a pedicle breach. The negative predictive value was 99.8{\{}{\%}{\}}, with a positive predictive value of 94{\{}{\%}{\}}. No adverse event was noted with the use of the electrical conductivity device. Electrical conductivity monitoring may provide a simple, safe and sensitive method of detecting pedicle breech during routine perforation of the pedicle, in the course of pedicle screw placement.},

Objective: To compare transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings between patients who underwent surgery for cervical spondylotic myelopathy and those with spondylosis who were not operated upon, and to correlate these findings with clinical functionality at follow-up. Setting: Private practice. Methods: Of 16 consecutive patients with cervical spondylosis 8 underwent surgery (group I) and 8 were treated conservatively (group II). We compared TMS and MRI findings between these groups and we correlated central motor conduction times (CMCTs) and MRI-measured sagittal and parasagittal diameters of the spinal canal at baseline evaluation, with clinical functionality at 2-year follow-up. Results: Group I CMCTs at the lower limbs correlated significantly with modified-JoA 2 years post surgery (r=-0.71, P{\textless}0.05), but MRI-measured diameters did not. In group II baseline TMS was unrevealing, contrary to significant spinal stenosis disclosed by MRI. The condition of none of these patients deteriorated at 2 years. Conclusions: CMCTs at the lower limbs, but not cervical spinal canal diameters, correlate with long-term functional outcome following surgical or conservative treatment.

abstract = {The number of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies regarding the human spine has considerably increased and it is challenging because of the spine's small size and artifacts associated with the most commonly used clinical imaging method. A novel segmentation method based on the reduced field-of-view (rFOV) DTI dataset is presented in cervical spinal canal cerebrospinal fluid, spinal cord grey matter and white matter classification in both healthy volunteers and patients with neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and multiple sclerosis (MS). Due to each channel based on high resolution rFOV DTI images providing complementary information on spinal tissue segmentation, we want to choose a different contribution map from multiple channel images. Via principal component analysis (PCA) and a hybrid diffusion filter with a continuous switch applied on fourteen channel features, eigen maps can be obtained and used for tissue segmentation based on the Bayesian discrimination method. Relative to segmentation by a pair of expert readers, all of the automated segmentation results in the experiment fall in the good segmentation area and performed well, giving an average segmentation accuracy of about 0.852 for cervical spinal cord grey matter in terms of volume overlap. Furthermore, this has important applications in defining more accurate human spinal cord tissue maps when fusing structural data with diffusion data. rFOV DTI and the proposed automatic segmentation outperform traditional manual segmentation methods in classifying MR cervical spinal images and might be potentially helpful for detecting cervical spine diseases in NMO and MS. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Quantitative analysis has tremendous but mostly unrealized potential in healthcare to support objective and accurate interpretation of the clinical imaging. In 2008, the National Cancer Institute began building the Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) initiative with the goal of advancing quantitative imaging in the context of personalized therapy and evaluation of treatment response. Computerized analysis is an important component contributing to reproducibility and efficiency of the quantitative imaging techniques. The success of quantitative imaging is contingent on robust analysis methods and software tools to bring these methods from bench to bedside. 3D Slicer is a free open-source software application for medical image computing. As a clinical research tool, 3D Slicer is similar to a radiology workstation that supports versatile visualizations but also provides advanced functionality such as automated segmentation and registration for a variety of application domains. Unlike a typical radiology workstation, 3D Slicer is free and is not tied to specific hardware. As a programming platform, 3D Slicer facilitates translation and evaluation of the new quantitative methods by allowing the biomedical researcher to focus on the implementation of the algorithm and providing abstractions for the common tasks of data communication, visualization and user interface development. Compared to other tools that provide aspects of this functionality, 3D Slicer is fully open source and can be readily extended and redistributed. In addition, 3D Slicer is designed to facilitate the development of new functionality in the form of 3D Slicer extensions. In this paper, we present an overview of 3D Slicer as a platform for prototyping, development and evaluation of image analysis tools for clinical research applications. To illustrate the utility of the platform in the scope of QIN, we discuss several use cases of 3D Slicer by the existing QIN teams, and we elaborate on the future directions that can further facilitate development and validation of imaging biomarkers using 3D Slicer.Copyright {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Acute spinal cord injury (SCI) is a traumatic event that results in disturbances to normal sensory, motor, or autonomic function and ultimately affects a patient's physical, psychological, and social well-being. The management of patients with SCI has drastically evolved over the past century as a result of increasing knowledge on injury mechanisms, disease pathophysiology, and the role of surgery. There still, however, remain controversial areas surrounding available management strategies for the treatment of SCI, including the use of corticosteroids such as methylprednisolone sodium succinate, the optimal timing of surgical intervention, the type and timing of anticoagulation prophylaxis, the role of magnetic resonance imaging, and the type and timing of rehabilitation. This lack of consensus has prevented the standardization of care across treatment centers and among the various disciplines that encounter patients with SCI. The objective of this guideline is to form evidence-based recommendations for these areas of controversy and outline how to best manage patients with SCI. The ultimate goal of these guidelines is to improve outcomes and reduce morbidity in patients with SCI by promoting standardization of care and encouraging clinicians to make evidence-informed decisions.},

abstract = {Functional hemispheric asymmetries of speech production and perception are a key feature of the human language system, but their neurophysiological basis is still poorly understood. Using a combined fMRI and tract-based spatial statistics approach, we investigated the relation of microstructural asymmetries in language-relevant white matter pathways and functional activation asymmetries during silent verb generation and passive listening to spoken words. Tract-based spatial statistics revealed several leftward asymmetric clusters in the arcuate fasciculus and uncinate fasciculus that were differentially related to activation asymmetries in the two functional tasks. Frontal and temporal activation asymmetries during silent verb generation were positively related to the strength of specific microstructural white matter asymmetries in the arcuate fasciculus. In contrast, microstructural uncinate fasciculus asymmetries were related to temporal activation asymmetries during passive listening. These findings suggest that white matter asymmetries may indeed be one of the factors underlying functional hemispheric asymmetries. Moreover, they also show that specific localized white matter asymmetries might be of greater relevance for functional activation asymmetries than microstructural features of whole pathways. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND In degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM), the dynamics of disease progression and the outcome after surgical decompression vary interindividually and do not necessarily correlate with radiological findings. OBJECTIVE To improve diagnostic power in DCM by better characterization of the underlying pathophysiology using navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS). METHODS Eighteen patients with DCM due to cervical spinal canal stenosis were examined preoperatively with nTMS. On the basis of the initial Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) Score, 2 patient groups were established (JOA ≤12/{\textgreater}12). We determined the resting motor threshold, recruitment curve, cortical silent period, and motor area. Accordingly, 8 healthy subjects were examined. RESULTS Although the resting motor threshold was comparable in both groups (P = .578), the corticospinal excitability estimated by the recruitment curve was reduced in patients (P = .022). In patients with only mild symptoms (JOA {\textgreater} 12), a compensatory higher activation of non-primary motor areas was detected (P {\textless} .005). In contrast, patients with severe impairment (JOA ≤ 12) showed a higher cortical inhibition (P {\textless} .05) and reduced cortical motor area (P {\textless} .05) revealing a functional restriction on the cortical level. CONCLUSION Based on these results, we propose a new concept for functional compensation for DCM on the cortical and spinal level, ie corticospinal reserve capacity. nTMS is a useful tool to noninvasively characterize the pattern of functional impairment and compensatory reorganization in patients suffering from DCM. The change in nTMS parameters might serve as a valuable prognostic factor in these patients in the future.},

abstract = {Patients with severe grades of life-threatening brain injury are commonly characterized as having devastating brain injury (DBI), which we have defined as: ‘any neurological condition that is assessed at the time of hospital admission as an immediate threat to life or incompatible with good functional recovery AND where early limitation or withdrawal of therapy is being considered'. The outcome in patients with DBI is often death or severe disability, and as a consequence rapid withdrawal of life sustaining therapies is commonly contemplated or undertaken. However, accurate prognostication in life-threatening brain injury is difficult, particularly at an early stage. Evidence from controlled studies to guide decision-making is limited, and there is a risk of a 'self-fulfilling prophecy', with early prognostication leading to early withdrawal of life sustaining therapies and death. The Joint Professional Standards committee of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine and the Intensive Care Society convened a consensus group with representation from stakeholder professional organizations to develop clear professional guidance in this area. It recognized that the weak evidence base makes GRADE guidelines difficult to justify. We have made 12 practical, pragmatic recommendations to help clinicians deliver safe, effective, equitable, and justifiable care within resource constrained healthcare systems. In the situation where patient-centred outcomes are recognized to be unacceptable, regardless of the extent of neurological improvement, then early transition to palliative care is appropriate. These recommendations are intended to apply where the primary pathology is DBI, rather than where DBI has compounded a progressive and irreversible deterioration in other life-threatening comorbidities.},

In this study, screw placement within the pedicle is measured (post-op CT scan, horizontal and vertical distance from the screw edge to the surface of the pedicle) and correlated with intraoperative neurophysiological stimulation thresholds.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A single surgeon placed 68 thoracic and 136 lumbar screws in 30 consecutive patients during instrumented fusion under EMG control. The female to male ratio was 1.6 and the average age was 61.3 years (SD 17.7). Radiological measurements, blinded to stimulation threshold, were done on reformatted CT reconstructions using OsiriX software. A standard deviation of the screw position of 2.8 mm was determined from pilot measurements, and a 1 mm of screw-pedicle edge distance was considered as a difference of interest (standardised difference of 0.35) leading to a power of the study of 75 {\%} (significance level 0.05).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Correct placement and stimulation thresholds above 10 mA were found in 71 {\%} of screws. Twenty-two percent of screws caused cortical breach, 80 {\%} of these had stimulation thresholds above 10 mA (sensitivity 20 {\%}, specificity 90 {\%}). True prediction of correct position of the screw was more frequent for lumbar than for thoracic screws.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: A screw stimulation threshold of {\textgreater}10 mA does not indicate correct pedicle screw placement. A hypothesised gradual decrease of screw stimulation thresholds was not observed as screw placement approaches the nerve root. Aside from a robust threshold of 2 mA indicating direct contact with nervous tissue, a secondary threshold appears to depend on patients' pathology and surgical conditions.},

Studies also indicated that fluoroscopy-based navigation offers high accuracy and is comparable to CT-based assistance. However, different population characteristics and assessment methods resulted in inconsistent conclusions. We searched OVID, Springer, and MEDLINE databases to conduct a meta-analysis of the published literature specifically looking at accuracy of pedicle screw placement with different navigation methods. Subgroups and descriptive statistics were determined based on the subject type (in vivo or cadaveric), navigational method, and spinal level. A total number of 7,533 pedicle screws were summarised in our database with 6,721 screws accurately inserted into the pedicles (89.22{\%}). Overall, the median placement accuracy for the in vivo CT-based navigation subgroup (90.76{\%}) was higher than that with the use of two-dimensional (2D) fluoroscopy-based navigation (85.48{\%}). We concluded that CT-based navigation could provide a higher accuracy in the placement of pedicle screws for all subgroups presented. In the lumbar level, 2D fluoroscopy-based navigation was comparable with CT-based navigation. Discrepancy between the two navigation types increased in the thoracic level for the in vivo populations, where there was less potential in the use of 2D fluoroscopy-based navigation than CT-based navigation.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this guideline is to present current and comprehensive recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. METHODS: A formal literature search of PubMed was performed through the end of August 2013. The writing committee met by teleconference to discuss narrative text and recommendations. Recommendations follow the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association methods of classifying the level of certainty of the treatment effect and the class of evidence. Prerelease review of the draft guideline was performed by 6 expert peer reviewers and by the members of the Stroke Council Scientific Oversight Committee and Stroke Council Leadership Committee. RESULTS: Evidence-based guidelines are presented for the care of patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage. Topics focused on diagnosis, management of coagulopathy and blood pressure, prevention and control of secondary brain injury and intracranial pressure, the role of surgery, outcome prediction, rehabilitation, secondary prevention, and future considerations. Results of new phase 3 trials were incorporated. CONCLUSIONS: Intracerebral hemorrhage remains a serious condition for which early aggressive care is warranted. These guidelines provide a framework for goal-directed treatment of the patient with intracerebral hemorrhage.},

abstract = {A series of 66 spinal cord neurofibromas was analyzed for history, signs, surgical approach, and outcome. The tumors presented primarily with sensory symptoms. Plain films were abnormal in 1/2 of cases and 1/2 had a complete block. They were primarily intradural, and primarily thoracic. A conservative exam system was used for follow-up and 85{\%} with pain had complete relief; 50{\%} with motor loss had normal motor function, and 88{\%} had normal sensation who had prior sensory loss. In comparison to meningiomas, the principal differences were that neurofibromas had an even sex distribution, a lower incidence of cord signs and symptoms, more frequent findings on plain x-rays, and higher cerebrospinal fluid protein. Surgical outcome was similar. Sacrifice of the involved root during removal usually did not produce a deficit. The series is compared with a similar series of meningiomas from the same institution over the same time period.},

abstract = {Background: Segmentation of the gray and white matter (GM, WM) of the human spinal cord in MRI images as well as the analysis of spinal cord diffusivity are challenging. When appropriately segmented, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the spinal cord might be beneficial in the diagnosis and prognosis of several diseases. Purpose: To evaluate the applicability of a semiautomatic algorithm provided by ITK-SNAP in classification mode (CLASS) for segmenting cervical spinal cord GM, WM in MRI images and analyzing DTI parameters. Study Type: Prospective. Subjects: Twenty healthy volunteers. Sequences: 1.5T, turbo spin echo, fast field echo, single-shot echo planar imaging. Assessment: Three raters segmented the tissues by manual, CLASS, and atlas-based methods (Spinal Cord Toolbox, SCT) on T2-weighted and DTI images. Masks were quantified by similarity and distance metrics, then analyzed for repeatability and mutual comparability. Masks created over T2 images were registered into diffusion space and frac- tional anisotropy (FA) values were statistically evaluated for dependency on method, rater, or tissue. Statistical Tests: t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), coefficient of variation, Dice coefficient, Hausdorff distance. Results: CLASS segmentation reached better agreement with manual segmentation than did SCT (P{\textless}0.001). Intra- and interobserver repeatability of SCT was better for GM and WM (both P{\textless}0.001) but comparable with CLASS in entire spinal cord segmentation (P50.17 and P50.07, respectively). While FA values of whole spinal cord were not influenced by choice of segmentation method, both semiautomatic methods yielded lower FA values (P{\textless}0.005) for GM than did the manual technique (mean differences 0.02 and 0.04 for SCT and CLASS, respectively). Repeatability of FA values for all methods was sufficient, with mostly less than 2{\%} variance. Data Conclusion: The presented semiautomatic method in combination with the proposed approach to data registra- tion and analyses of spinal cord diffusivity can potentially be used as an alternative to atlas-based segmentation. Level of Evidence: 1 Technical},

abstract = {Changes in gamma oscillations (20–50 Hz) have been observed in several neurological disorders. However, the relationship between gamma oscillations and cellular pathologies is unclear. Here we show reduced, behaviourally driven gamma oscillations before the onset of plaque formation or cognitive decline in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Optogenetically driving fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive (FS-PV)-interneurons at gamma (40 Hz), but not other frequencies, reduces levels of amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$)1–40 and A$\beta$ 1–42 isoforms. Gene expression profiling revealed induction of genes associated with morphological transformation of microglia, and histological analysis confirmed increased microglia co-localization with A$\beta$. Subsequently, we designed a non-invasive 40 Hz light-flickering regime that reduced A$\beta$1–40 and A$\beta$1–42 levels in the visual cortex of pre-depositing mice and mitigated plaque load in aged, depositing mice. Our findings uncover a previously unappreciated function of gamma rhythms in recruiting both neuronal and glial responses to attenuate Alzheimer's-disease-associated pathology.},

@article{Nitta2015,
abstract = {OBJECT There is no standard therapeutic strategy for low-grade glioma (LGG). The authors hypothesized that adjuvant therapy might not be necessary for LGG cases in which total radiological resection was achieved. Accordingly, they established a treatment strategy based on the extent of resection (EOR) and the MIB-1 index: patients with a high EOR and low MIB-1 index were observed without postoperative treatment, whereas those with a low EOR and/or high MIB-1 index received radiotherapy (RT) and/or chemotherapy. In the present retrospective study, the authors reviewed clinical data on patients with primarily diagnosed LGGs who had been treated according to the above-mentioned strategy, and they validated the treatment policy. Given their results, they will establish a new treatment strategy for LGGs stratified by EOR, histological subtype, and molecular status. METHODS One hundred fifty-three patients with diagnosed LGG who had undergone resection or biopsy at Tokyo Women's Medical University between January 2000 and August 2010 were analyzed. The patients consisted of 84 men and 69 women, all with ages ≥ 15 years. A total of 146 patients underwent surgical removal of the tumor, and 7 patients underwent biopsy. RESULTS Postoperative RT and nitrosourea-based chemotherapy were administered in 48 and 35 patients, respectively. Extent of resection was significantly associated with both overall survival (OS; p = 0.0096) and progression-free survival (PFS; p = 0.0007) in patients with diffuse astrocytoma but not in those with oligodendroglial subtypes. Chemotherapy significantly prolonged PFS, especially in patients with oligodendroglial subtypes (p = 0.0009). Patients with a mutant IDH1 gene had significantly longer OS (p = 0.034). Multivariate analysis did not identify MIB-1 index or RT as prognostic factors, but it did identify chemotherapy as a prognostic factor for PFS and EOR as a prognostic factor for OS and PFS. CONCLUSIONS The findings demonstrated that EOR was significantly correlated with patient survival; thus, one should aim for maximum tumor resection. In addition, patients with a higher EOR can be safely observed without adjuvant therapy. For patients with partial resection, postoperative chemotherapy should be administered for those with oligodendroglial subtypes, and repeat resection should be considered for those with astrocytic tumors. More aggressive treatment with RT and chemotherapy may be required for patients with a poor prognosis, such as those with diffuse astrocytoma, 1p/19q nondeleted tumors, or IDH1 wild-type oligodendroglial tumors with partial resection.},

abstract = {Surgical treatment of deep-seated insular lesions causing refractory epilepsy is thought to be difficult due to the complicated accessibility and close proximity of eloquent areas. Here we report our experience with insular lesionectomies. Twenty-four patients (range 1-62 years, mean 27) who underwent epilepsy-surgery for a lesion involving the insular region, were identified from the epilepsy surgery data bank. We analysed pre-surgical diagnostics, surgical strategy and postoperative follow up concerning functional morbidity and seizure outcome (range 12-168 months, mean 37.5). Eight patients had pure insular lesions, in 16 cases the lesion extended either to the frontal (n = 3) or temporal lobe (n = 8) or was multilobar (n = 5). Sixteen resections (66.7{\%}) were done on the right side. Six patients required invasive EEG-recording, three patients received intra-operative electrocorticography. In seven patients only subtotal resection of the insular lesion was possible due to involvement of eloquent areas. Thirteen patients suffered from glial/glioneural tumours (WHO grades I-III), 11 from non-neoplastic lesions. Postoperatively, one patient had a hemihypesthesia and one patient had a deterioration of a pre-existing hemiparesis; two patients had a hemianopia as calculated deficit (mild permanent morbidity 16.6{\%}). According to the ILAE-classification, 15 patients were completely seizure free (62.5{\%}, ILAE 1). Around 79.2{\%} had satisfactory seizure outcome (ILAE 1-3). In selected patients an individually tailored lesionectomy of insular lesions can be performed, which is acceptably safe and provides a high rate of satisfactory seizure relief. Even subtotal resection can result in good seizure control.},

Theoretical lordosis can be evaluated from the measurement of the pelvic incidence and from the analysis of spatial organization of the lumbar spine with 2/3 of the lordosis given by the L4-S1 segment and 85{\%} by the L3-S1 segment. Technical aspects involve patient positioning on the operating table, release maneuvers, type of instrumentation used (rod, screw-rod connection, interbody cages), surgical sequence and the overall surgical strategy. Spinal osteotomies may be required in case of fixed kyphotic spine. AP combined surgery is particularly efficient in restoring lordosis at L5-S1 level and should be recommended. Finally, not one but several strategies may be used to achieve the need for restoration of adequate lordosis during fusion surgery.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive memory decline and subsequent loss of broader cognitive functions. Memory decline in the early stages of AD is mostly limited to episodic memory, for which the hippocampus has a crucial role. However, it has been uncertain whether the observed amnesia in the early stages of AD is due to disrupted encoding and consolidation of episodic information, or an impairment in the retrieval of stored memory information. Here we show that in transgenic mouse models of early AD, direct optogenetic activation of hippocampal memory engram cells results in memory retrieval despite the fact that these mice are amnesic in long-term memory tests when natural recall cues are used, revealing a retrieval, rather than a storage impairment. Before amyloid plaque deposition, the amnesia in these mice is age-dependent, which correlates with a progressive reduction in spine density of hippocampal dentate gyrus engram cells. We show that optogenetic induction of long-term potentiation at perforant path synapses of dentate gyrus engram cells restores both spine density and long-term memory. We also demonstrate that an ablation of dentate gyrus engram cells containing restored spine density prevents the rescue of long-term memory. Thus, selective rescue of spine density in engram cells may lead to an effective strategy for treating memory loss in the early stages of AD.},

Seventeen patients were managed conservatively, 30 underwent ventricular drainage, and in six patients the haematoma was evacuated. The indications for the different modes of treatment are discussed. The most significant prognostic factors determining the outcome at one month were the grade of quadrigeminal cistern obliteration on the initial CT scan and the Glasgow Coma Scale on admission. Patients with normal cisterns had a good outcome, and only needed (temporary) ventricular drainage in case of hydrocephalus. Patients with totally obliterated cisterns had a bad outcome irrespective of treatment. In the patients with compressed cisterns, it is suggested that evacuation of the haematoma might improve outcome; treatment of hydrocephalus alone is insufficient in many cases in this group.},

abstract = {The rates of survival, tumor recurrence, and tumor progression were analyzed in 225 patients with meningioma who underwent surgery as the only treatment modality between 1962 and 1980. Patients were considered to have a recurrence if their studies verified a mass effect in spite of a complete surgical removal, whereas they were defined as having progression if, after a subtotal excision, there was clear radiological documentation of an increase in the size of their tumor. There were 168 females and 57 males (a ratio of 2.9:1), with a peak incidence of tumor occurrence in the fifth (23{\%}), sixth (29{\%}), and seventh (23{\%}) decades of life. Anatomical locations were the convexity (21{\%}), parasagittal area (17{\%}), sphenoid ridge (16{\%}), posterior fossa (14{\%}), parasellar region (12{\%}), olfactory groove (10{\%}), spine (8{\%}), and orbit (2{\%}). The absolute 5-, 10-, and 15-year survival rates were 83{\%}, 77{\%}, and 69{\%}, respectively. Following a total resection, the recurrence-free rate at 5, 10, and 15 years was 93{\%}, 80{\%}, and 68{\%}, respectively, at all sites. In contrast, after a subtotal resection, the progression-free rate was only 63{\%}, 45{\%}, and 9{\%} during the same period (p less than 0.0001). The probability of having a second operation following a total excision after 5, 10, and 15 years was 6{\%}, 15{\%}, and 20{\%}, whereas after a subtotal excision the probability was 25{\%}, 44{\%}, and 84{\%}, respectively (p less than 0.0001). Tumor sites associated with a high percentage of total excisions had a low recurrence/progression rate.

Behavioral abnormalities were eliminated in seven of 20 patients and markedly improved in nine others. Convulsions were eliminated in four of 21 patients and improved in 12. Stereotaxic amygdalotomy produced overall improvement in 23 of 25 patients. Two of 12 patients committed to mental institutions have been released. Five of eight patients whose commitment to mental institutions was impending have improved after amygdalotomy so that institutionalization is no longer considered. Depression was not permanently improved in the two parkinsonian patients undergoing amygdalotomy. Stereotaxic amygdalotomy is a safe and relatively easy procedure for treatment of a select group of patients who have previously been considered untreatable.},

abstract = {In the past decade, several studies have reported potential prognostic factors for aphasia after stroke. However, these reports covered no more than 1 year after stroke onset, even though patients often continue to improve over longer periods. The present study included 121 patients with aphasia who received cognitive-based linguistic rehabilitation for at least 2 years post-onset. All were right-handed and had a lesion only in the left hemisphere. Aphasia outcome was predicted using multiple linear regression analysis. Age at onset, lesion in the left superior temporal gyrus including Wernicke's area, and baseline linguistic abilities including aphasia severity and both phonological and semantic functions were significant predictors of long-term aphasia outcome. These findings suggest that the long-term outcome of aphasia following adequate linguistic rehabilitation can be predicted by age at onset, lesion area, and baseline linguistic abilities and that linguistic rehabilitation is particularly recommended for younger individuals with aphasia.},

abstract = {Human language requires constant learning of new words, leading to the acquisition of an average vocabulary of more than 30,000 words in adult life. The ability to learn new words is highly variable and may rely on the integration between auditory and motor information. Here, we combined diffusion imaging tractography and functional MRI to study whether the strength of anatomical and functional connectivity between auditory and motor language networks is associated with word learning ability. Our results showed that performance in word learning correlates with microstructural properties and strength of functional connectivity of the direct connections between Broca's and Wernicke's territories in the left hemisphere. This study suggests that our ability to learn new words relies on an efficient and fast communication between temporal and frontal areas. The absence of these connections in other animals may explain the unique ability of learning words in humans.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this review we focus on recent findings in the anesthetic management of patients undergoing craniotomy while awake, and propose a structured approach to the clinical practice of 'anesthesia' for awake neurosurgery. RECENT FINDINGS: The increasing use of functional neurosurgery and recent evidence favoring resection of tumor involving eloquent cortex has expanded the indications for awake craniotomy, a procedure needing a fully cooperative patient and expert intraoperative anesthetic management. Despite the shorter hospital stay, the more recently published studies have highlighted perioperative anesthetic complications and have proposed ways to improve anesthesia techniques for awake procedures in adults and children. SUMMARY: Although anesthesia for awake craniotomy is usually a well tolerated procedure it requires an extensive knowledge of the principles underlying neuroanesthesia and of specific technical strategies including local anesthesia for scalp blockade, advanced airway management, dedicated sedation protocols, and skillful management of hemodynamics.},

abstract = {The rates of survival, tumor recurrence, and tumor progression were analyzed in 225 patients with meningioma who underwent surgery as the only treatment modality between 1962 and 1980. Patients were considered to have a recurrence if their studies verified a mass effect in spite of a complete surgical removal, whereas they were defined as having progression if, after a subtotal excision, there was clear radiological documentation of an increase in the size of their tumor. There were 168 females and 57 males (a ratio of 2.9:1), with a peak incidence of tumor occurrence in the fifth (23{\%}), sixth (29{\%}), and seventh (23{\%}) decades of life. Anatomical locations were the convexity (21{\%}), parasagittal area (17{\%}), sphenoid ridge (16{\%}), posterior fossa (14{\%}), parasellar region (12{\%}), olfactory groove (10{\%}), spine (8{\%}), and orbit (2{\%}). The absolute 5-, 10-, and 15-year survival rates were 83{\%}, 77{\%}, and 69{\%}, respectively. Following a total resection, the recurrence-free rate at 5, 10, and 15 years was 93{\%}, 80{\%}, and 68{\%}, respectively, at all sites. In contrast, after a subtotal resection, the progression-free rate was only 63{\%}, 45{\%}, and 9{\%} during the same period (p less than 0.0001). The probability of having a second operation following a total excision after 5, 10, and 15 years was 6{\%}, 15{\%}, and 20{\%}, whereas after a subtotal excision the probability was 25{\%}, 44{\%}, and 84{\%}, respectively (p less than 0.0001). Tumor sites associated with a high percentage of total excisions had a low recurrence/progression rate. For example, 96{\%} of convexity meningiomas were removed in toto, and the recurrence/progression rate at 5 years was only 3{\%}. Parasellar meningiomas, with a 57{\%} total excision rate, had a 5-year probability of recurrence/progression of 19{\%}.

METHODS: A prospective survey of all cases of SIH presenting to a large neuroscience unit over a two year period. RESULTS: Nine cases of SIH were seen. Four of these were complicated by acute clinical deterioration with reduced conscious level because of large subdural haematomas requiring urgent neurosurgical drainage. CONCLUSIONS: SIH should not be considered a benign condition.

abstract = {Background. Although the consequences of spinal cord injury (SCI) within the spinal cord and peripheral nervous system have been studied extensively, the influence of SCI on supraspinal structures during recovery remains largely unexplored. Objective. To assess temporal changes in cortical sensorimotor representations beginning in the subacute phase following SCI and determine if an association exists between the plastic changes within cortical sensorimotor areas and recovery of movement postinjury. Methods. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to study 6 SCI patients for 1 year, beginning shortly postinjury, and 10 healthy control individuals. During fMRI, individuals performed a simple self-paced wrist extension motor task. Recovery of movement was assessed using the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Standard Neurological Classification of SCI. Results. In the subacute period post-SCI, during impaired movement, little task-related activation within the primary motor cortex (M1) was present, whereas activation in associated cortical sensorimotor areas was more extensive than in controls. During motor recovery, a progressive enlargement in the volume of movement-related M1 activation and decreased activation in associated cortical sensorimotor areas was seen. When movement was performed with little to no impairment, the overall pattern of cortical activation was similar to that observed in control individuals. Conclusions. This study provides the first report of the temporal progression of cortical sensorimotor representational plasticity during recovery following traumatic SCI in humans and suggests an association between movement-related fMRI activation and motor recovery postinjury. These findings have implications on current and future rehabilitative interventions for patients with SCI. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2007 The American Society of Neurorehabilitation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The efficacy of fusion surgery in addition to decompression surgery in patients who have lumbar spinal stenosis, with or without degenerative spondylolisthesis, has not been sub- stantiated in controlled trials. METHODS We randomly assigned 247 patients between 50 and 80 years of age who had lumbar spinal stenosis at one or two adjacent vertebral levels to undergo either decompression surgery plus fusionsurgery(fusiongroup)ordecompressionsurgeryalone(decompression-alonegroup). Randomization was stratified according to the presence of preoperative degenerative spondylolisthesis (in 135 patients) or its absence. Outcomes were assessed with the use of pa- tient-reported outcome measures, a 6-minute walk test, and a health economic evaluation. The primary outcome was the score on the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI; which ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more severe disability) 2 years after surgery. The primary analysis, which was a per-protocol analysis, did not include the 14 patients who did not receive the assigned treatment and the 5 who were lost to follow-up. RESULTS There was no significant difference between the groups in the mean score on the ODI at 2 years (27 in the fusion group and 24 in the decompression-alone group, P=0.24) or in the results of the 6-minute walk test (397 m in the fusion group and 405 m in the decompres- sion-alone group, P=0.72). Results were similar between patients with and those without spondylolisthesis. Among the patients who had 5 years of follow-up and were eligible for inclusion in the 5-year analysis, there were no significant differences between the groups in clinical outcomes at 5 years. The mean length of hospitalization was 7.4 days in the fu- sion group and 4.1 days in the decompression-alone group (P{\textless}0.001). Operating time was longer, the amount of bleeding was greater, and surgical costs were higher in the fusion group than in the decompression-alone group. During a mean follow-up of 6.5 years, ad- ditional lumbar spine surgery was performed in 22{\%} of the patients in the fusion group and in 21{\%} of those in the decompression-alone group. CONCLUSIONS Among patients with lumbar spinal stenosis, with or without degenerative spondylolisthe- sis, decompression surgery plus fusion surgery did not result in better clinical outcomes at 2 years and 5 years than did decompression surgery alone.},

abstract = {Study Design: Narrative review with commentary. Objectives: The growing use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) often leaves clinicians faced with scenarios where imaging findings are inconsistent with the clinical picture. This is particularly relevant for degenerative cervical spinal cord compression (CSCC). In this article, we provide a focused narrative literature review to address whether (1) surgery should be offered to asymptomatic patients with CSCC and (2) should MRI spinal cord signal changes influence clinical decisions for a patient with mild myelopathy from CSCC? Methods: Illustrative cases are presented with expert commentary which is supplemented by a focused literature review. Results: The literature suggests that CSCC from degenerative pathology is a common incidental radiographic finding. For those without symptoms of myelopathy, the short-term risk of progression is low. There is a lack of evidence to support surgery for asymptomatic individuals with CSCC who have no risk factors for progression. For these patients, the authors suggest non-operative management that includes education on the symptoms of myelopathy, clinical follow-up within 6 to 12 months, and avoidance of high-risk activities. Conversely, symptomatic patients have a notable risk of progression. Surgical intervention improves neurological function and quality of life regardless of severity. The authors support surgery as an option for all patients with mild myelopathy who are appropriate operative candidates. Intramedullary signal change on MRI has not been shown to reliably predict progression. Conclusions: While MRI technologies are under evolution, we advise that surgical decisions for patients with CSCC should rely on clinical assessment and not imaging findings.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The white matter structure of the anterior temporal lobe and the frontotemporal region is complex and not well appreciated from the available neurosurgical literature. The fiber dissection method is an excellent means of attaining a thorough knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of the white matter tracts. This study was performed to demonstrate the usefulness of the dissection technique in understanding the white matter anatomy and the effects of current surgical approaches on the subcortical structure of the region. METHODS: Seventeen brain specimens obtained at routine autopsy were dissected by use of Klingler's fiber dissection technique after preparation by fixation and freezing. The dissections were performed with an operating microscope and followed a stepwise pattern of progressive white matter dissection. RESULTS: The dissection is described in an orderly fashion showing the white matter tracts of the anterior temporal lobe and the frontotemporal region. An insight is gained into the three-dimensional course of the anterior loop of the optic radiation, the temporal stem, the anterior commissure, and the ansa peduncularis. CONCLUSION: The anterior temporal lobe and the frontotemporal region contain several important white matter tracts that can be uniquely understood by performing a white matter dissection of the region. Surgical procedures on the anterior temporal lobe differ substantially as to their repercussions on the subcortical white matter tract anatomy, as shown by the findings in this study.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort. OBJECTIVE: To explore the correlations between diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) ratios and diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) grading with clinical symptoms and outcomes of cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: In addition to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography, DTI may be useful in understanding pathophysiology of spinal cord in earlier stages of the CSM but it may be confounded by age and cervical level, and previous studies had small sample sizes. METHODS: Controls (n = 36) and patients with CSM (n = 93) underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and DTI at the Changhai Hospital of Shanghai between September 2011 and March 2013. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), fractional anisotropy (FA) of white matter (WM), and central grey matter (GM) were assessed. Patients were divided into three MRI grades: no abnormal signals; increased T2WI; and increased T2WI and low T1WI. DTT images were divided into three grades: no abnormal signals; abnormal local signal cord and disordered fiber tracts; and distortion of the spinal cord and interrupted fiber tracts. RESULTS: FA and ADC both correlated with age in all three bilateral WM funiculi and GM, whereas FA and ADC ratios only showed correlation with age in the ventral funiculus (VF) and central GM. Differences were observed in ADC ratios and FA ratios from different Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score subgroups and JOA recovery subgroups. For the three WM funiculi and GM, correlations between DTI ratios, JOA scores, and JOA recovery rates were consistently higher than those between DTI values, JOA scores, and JOA recovery rates (all P {\textless} 0.05). MRI grading was correlated with the JOA scores (r = -0.674, P {\textless} 0.001) but not JOA recovery rates (r = -0.197, P = 0.058), whereas DTT grading was correlated with both JOA scores (r = -0.813, P {\textless} 0.001) and JOA recovery rate (r = -0.429, P {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSION: DTI parameter ratios seemed to be less influenced by age than raw DTI results and could be more valuable than absolute DTI parameters for the evaluation of CSM. DTT grading is more valuable than MRI grading for diagnosis and prognostic prediction in CSM patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Cerebrospinal fluid hypovolemia resulting in postural headaches is a well-known clinical entity, but severe forms of cerebrospinal fluid hypovolemia with altered mental status and signs of transtentorial herniation ("brain sag") have rarely been reported. This article describes the clinical features of brain sag after craniotomy in an attempt to increase recognition of this syndrome. METHODS: Between April 2001 and January 2003, 220 consecutive patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage were prospectively enrolled in the Columbia Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Outcomes Project; 137 underwent craniotomy for aneurysm clipping. Among these patients, the diagnosis of brain sag was made when all three of the following criteria were present: clinical signs of transtentorial herniation, head computed tomographic scans revealing effacement of the basal cisterns with an oblong brainstem, and improvement of symptoms after placement of the patient in the Trendelenburg position (-15 to -30 degrees). For each patient, the symptoms, clinical course, and subsequent response to treatment were characterized. In addition, brainstem dimensions were measured on computed tomographic scans taken before, during, and after resolution of brain sag. A "sag ratio" was generated for these time points by dividing the maximum anteroposterior distance by the maximum bipeduncular distance. RESULTS: Eleven (8.0{\%}) of 137 aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients treated by craniotomy and an intraoperative spinal drain met the criteria for brain sag. Signs of transtentorial herniation developed most commonly between 2 and 4 days postoperatively. Pupillary asymmetry was noted in 10 (91.0{\%}) of 11 patients, whereas the other patient demonstrated extensor posturing. The Trendelenburg position reversed the symptoms in all patients. The mean sag ratios before, during, and after resolution of brain sag were 0.91 +/- 0.03 (mean +/- standard error), 1.18 +/- 0.03, and 0.91 +/- 0.03, respectively. This represented a 30.9{\%} elongation of the brainstem during sag (P {\textless} 0.001) and a 23.6{\%} change back to baseline after resolution of the syndrome (P {\textless} 0.002). There was no significant difference between the presag and postsag ratios. CONCLUSION: Severe cerebrospinal fluid hypovolemia after craniotomy may produce a dramatic herniation syndrome that is completely reversed by the Trendelenburg position. Brain sag should be included in the differential diagnosis for acute postoperative clinical deterioration in this patient population.},

abstract = {Internal carotid artery (ICA) bifurcation aneurysms are relatively uncommon and frequently rupture at a younger age compared to other intracranial aneurysms. We have treated a total of 999 patients for intracranial aneurysms, of whom 89 (8.9{\%}) had ICA bifurcation aneurysms, and 42 of the 89 patients were 30 years of age or younger. The present study analyzed the clinical records of 70 patients with ICA bifurcation aneurysms treated from mid 1997 to mid 2003. Multiple aneurysms were present in 15 patients. Digital subtraction angiography films were studied in 55 patients to identify vasospasm and aneurysm projection. The aneurysm projected superiorly in most of these patients (37/55, 67.3{\%}). We preferred to minimize frontal lobe retraction, so widely opened the sylvian fissure to approach the ICA bifurcation and aneurysm neck. Elective temporary clipping was employed before the final dissection and permanent clip application. Vasospasm was present in 24 (43.6{\%}) of 55 patients. Forty-eight (68.6{\%}) of the 70 patients had good outcome, 14 (20{\%}) had poor outcome, and eight (11.4{\%}) died. Patients with ICA bifurcation aneurysms tend to bleed at a much younger age compared to those with other intracranial aneurysms. Wide opening of the sylvian fissure and elective temporary clipping of the ICA reduces the risk of intraoperative rupture and perforator injury. Mortality was mainly due to poor clinical grade and intraoperative premature aneurysm rupture.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Due to uncertain evidence, lumbar fusion for degenerative indications is associated with the greatest measured practice variation of any surgical procedure. OBJECTIVE: To summarize the current evidence on the comparative safety and efficacy of lumbar fusion, decompression-alone, or nonoperative care for degenerative indications. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (up to June 30, 2016). Comparative studies reporting validated measures of safety or efficacy were included. Treatment effects were calculated through DerSimonian and Laird random effects models. RESULTS: The literature search yielded 65 studies (19 randomized controlled trials, 16 prospective cohort studies, 15 retrospective cohort studies, and 15 registries) enrolling a total of 302 620 patients. Disability, pain, and patient satisfaction following fusion, decompression-alone, or nonoperative care were dependent on surgical indications and study methodology. Relative to decompression-alone, the risk of reoperation following fusion was increased for spinal stenosis (relative risk [RR] 1.17, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 1.06-1.28) and decreased for spondylolisthesis (RR 0.75, 95{\%} CI 0.68-0.83). Among patients with spinal stenosis, complications were more frequent following fusion (RR 1.87, 95{\%} CI 1.18-2.96). Mortality was not significantly associated with any treatment modality. CONCLUSION: Positive clinical change was greatest in patients undergoing fusion for spondylolisthesis while complications and the risk of reoperation limited the benefit of fusion for spinal stenosis. The relative safety and efficacy of fusion for chronic low back pain suggests careful patient selection is required (PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews number, CRD42015020153).},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively evaluate seizure outcome in a case-series of patients with nodular heterotopy (NH)-related epilepsy treated by stereo-EEG (SEEG)-guided radio-frequency thermocoagulation (RF-THC) of the NH. METHODS: Five patients (three male, age 5-33 years) with drug-resistant focal epilepsy presented a single NH at brain MRI. Following video-EEG monitoring, patients underwent SEEG recording to better identify the epileptogenic zone. All patients received RF-THC of the NH, using contiguous contacts of the electrodes employed for recording. The contacts for RF-THC lesions were chosen according to anatomical (intranodular position) and electrical (intranodular ictal low-voltage fast activity) criteria. RESULTS: At SEEG recordings, ictal discharge originated from the NH alone in three cases and from the NH and ipsilateral hippocampus in one case. In the remaining case, different sites of ictal onset, including the NH, were identified within the left frontal lobe. No adverse effects related to the RF-THC procedures were observed, apart from a habitual seizure that occurred during coagulation in one patient. Postprocedural sustained seizure freedom was detected in four cases (mean follow-up 33.5 months). In the case with left frontal multifocal ictal activity, RF-THC of the NH provided no benefit on seizures, and the patient is seizure-free after left frontal lobe resection. CONCLUSIONS: SEEG-guided RF-THC proved to be a safe and effective option in our small case-series of NH-related focal epilepsy. The indications to this treatment were strictly dependent on findings of intracerebral recording by SEEG, which can define the role of the NH in the generation of the ictal discharge.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 International Spinal Cord Society All rights reserved. Study design: Retrospective study. Objectives: Few studies have reported a relationship between central motor conduction time (CMCT), which evaluates corticospinal function, and degree of spinal cord compression in patients with myelopathy. Thus, there is no consensus on predicting the degree of prolonged CMCT on the basis of the degree of spinal cord compression. If a correlation exists between CMCT and spinal cord compression, then spinal cord compression may be a useful noninvasive clinical indicator of corticospinal function. Therefore, this study evaluated the relationship between CMCT and cervical spinal cord compression measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). Setting: Hiroshima University Hospital in Japan. Methods: We studied 33 patients undergoing laminoplasty. Patients exhibited significant cervical spinal cord compression on both MRI and intraoperative electrophysiological examination. We assessed transcranial magnetic stimulation measurement of CMCT; spinal cord compression parameters such as area, lateral diameter, anteroposterior diameter and flattening of the spinal cord at the lesion site and C2/3 levels on MRI; and pre- versus postoperative Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scores. Results: Correlations between CMCT and flattening as well as anteroposterior diameter of the spinal cord at the lesion level were observed. Strong correlations between CMCT and the ratio of the flattening and anteroposterior diameter parameters at the lesion level to that at the C2/3 level were also observed. Conclusions: Measurement of spinal cord compression may be useful for the evaluation of corticospinal function as a proxy for CMCT in patients with CSM.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: We aimed to determine cut-offs between mild, moderate and severe myelopathy on the modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) score. METHODS: Between December 2005 and January 2011, 757 patients with clinically diagnosed DCM were enrolled in the prospective AOSpine North America (n = 278) or International (n = 479) study at 26 sites. Functional status and quality of life were evaluated at baseline using a variety of outcome measures. Using the Nurick score as an anchor, receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis was conducted to determine cut-offs between mild, moderate and severe disease. The validity of the identified cut-offs was evaluated by examining whether patients in different severity groups differed in terms of impairment, disability, quality of life and number of signs and symptoms. RESULTS: A mJOA of 14 was determined to be the cut-off between mild and moderate myelopathy and a mJOA of 11 was the cut-off score between moderate and severe disease. Patients in the severe myelopathy group (n = 254) had significantly reduced quality of life and functional status and a greater number of signs and symptoms compared to patients classified as mild (n = 190) or moderate (n = 296). CONCLUSIONS: Mild myelopathy can be defined as mJOA from 15 to 17, moderate as mJOA from 12 to 14 and severe as mJOA from 0 to 11. These categories should be adopted worldwide to standardize clinical assessment of DCM.},

It is frequently associated with other congenital anomalies, often including occult spinal dysraphism. Mutations in the MNX1 gene are identified in the majority of cases. The authors report a rare case of Currarino syndrome in an infant with tethered cord syndrome and a dorsal lipomyelomeningocele continuous with a presacral intradural spinal lipoma, in addition to an imperforate anus and a scimitar sacrum. They review the literature to highlight patterns of occult spinal dysraphism in patients with Currarino syndrome and their relationship to tethered cord syndrome. Approximately 60{\%} of the patients with Currarino syndrome reported in the literature have an occult spinal dysraphism. Published studies suggest that the risk of tethered cord syndrome may be higher among patients with a lipoma and lower among those with a teratoma or anterior meningocele.},

abstract = {Purpose: This study used TMS mapping to investigate the motor representation of the abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscles in a group of patients with focal epilepsy originating in central or pre-central region. Methods: Eight epileptic patients and eight control subjects participated in the study. The coil was moved in 1.5-cm steps along a grid drawn on the subject's skull over the motor cortex of both hemispheres. At each site, six APB motor responses (evoked by TMS at 1.2 times the resting motor threshold) were recorded and averaged. The peak-to-peak amplitude was measured and plotted against the mediolateral and anteroposterior coil positions. The area of each APB muscle representation was measured and the position of the optimal point was calculated. Results: The resting motor threshold was increased bilaterally in epileptic patients. The maps were distorted in most patients (but not in control subjects), as evidenced by an off-centre optimal point. Interhemispheric differences in APB map areas were greater in patients than in control subjects. However, whether these increases in map area were on the epileptic side or on healthy side depended on the given subject. Conclusions: The changes in APB representation observed in epileptic patients demonstrate that reorganization occurs within the motor cortex. The heterogeneity of the present results is probably related to different locations of the epileptogenic and/or lesional areas and to a variety of compensatory phenomena that may occur, notably with respect to the disease duration. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

However, awake craniotomy failures have not been well characterized. In the present study, the authors aimed to analyze and assess the incidence and causes for failed awake craniotomy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The database of awake craniotomies performed at Tel Aviv Medical Center between 2003 and 2010 was reviewed. Awake craniotomy was considered a failure if conversion to general anesthesia was required, or if adequate mapping or monitoring could not have been achieved.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Of 488 patients undergoing awake craniotomy, 424 were identified as having complete medical, operative, and anesthesiology records. The awake craniotomies performed in 27 (6.4{\%}) of these 424 patients were considered failures. The main causes of failure were lack of intraoperative communication with the patient (n = 18 [4.2{\%}]) and/or intraoperative seizures (n = 9 [2.1{\%}]). Preoperative mixed dysphasia (p {\textless} 0.001) and treatment with phenytoin (p = 0.0019) were related to failure due to lack of communication. History of seizures (p = 0.03) and treatment with multiple antiepileptic drugs (p = 0.0012) were found to be related to failure due to intraoperative seizures. Compared with the successful awake craniotomy group, a significantly lower rate of gross-total resection was achieved (83{\%} vs 54{\%}, p = 0.008), there was a higher incidence of short-term speech deterioration postoperatively (6.1{\%} vs 23.5{\%}, p = 0.0017) as well as at 3 months postoperatively (2.3{\%} vs 15.4{\%}, p = 0.0002), and the hospitalization period was longer (4.9 ± 6.2 days vs 8.0 ± 10.1 days, p {\textless} 0.001). Significantly more major complications occurred in the failure group (4 [14.8{\%}] of 27) than in the successful group (16 [4{\%}] of 397) (p = 0.037).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Failures of awake craniotomy were associated with a lower incidence of gross-total resection and increased postoperative morbidity. The majority of awake craniotomy failures were preventable by adequate patient selection and avoiding side effects of drugs administered during surgery.},

The extent of covid-19 involvement in the central nervous system is not well established, and the presence or the absence of SARS-CoV-2 particles in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a topic of debate. Case description: We present two patients with covid-19 and concurrent neurological symptoms. Our first patient is a 31-year-old man who had flu-like symptoms due to covid-19 and later developed an acute-onset severe headache and loss of consciousness and was diagnosed with a Hunt and Hess grade 3 subarachnoid haemorrhage from a ruptured aneurysm. Our second patient is a 62-year-old woman who had an ischaemic stroke with massive haemorrhagic conversion requiring a decompressive hemicraniectomy. Both patients' CSF was repeatedly negative on real-time PCR analysis despite concurrent neurological disease. Conclusion: Our report shows that patients' CSF may be devoid of viral particles even when they test positive for covid-19 on a nasal swab. Whether SARS-CoV-2 is present in CSF may depend on the systemic disease severity and the degree of the virus' nervous tissue tropism and should be examined in future studies.},

abstract = {Background The balance of risk and benefit from early neurosurgical intervention for conscious patients with superficial lobar intracerebral haemorrhage of 10-100 mL and no intraventricular haemorrhage admitted within 48 h of ictus is unclear. We therefore tested the hypothesis that early surgery compared with initial conservative treatment could improve outcome in these patients. Methods In this international, parallel-group trial undertaken in 78 centres in 27 countries, we compared early surgical haematoma evacuation within 12 h of randomisation plus medical treatment with initial medical treatment alone (later evacuation was allowed if judged necessary). An automatic telephone and internet-based randomisation service was used to assign patients to surgery and initial conservative treatment in a 1:1 ratio. The trial was not masked. The primary outcome was a prognosis-based dichotomised (favourable or unfavourable) outcome of the 8 point Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) obtained by questionnaires posted to patients at 6 months. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN22153967. Findings 307 of 601 patients were randomly assigned to early surgery and 294 to initial conservative treatment; 298 and 291 were followed up at 6 months, respectively; and 297 and 286 were included in the analysis, respectively. 174 (59{\%}) of 297 patients in the early surgery group had an unfavourable outcome versus 178 (62{\%}) of 286 patients in the initial conservative treatment group (absolute difference 3??7{\%} [95{\%} CI -4??3 to 11??6], odds ratio 0??86 [0??62 to 1??20]; p=0??367). Interpretation The STICH II results confirm that early surgery does not increase the rate of death or disability at 6 months and might have a small but clinically relevant survival advantage for patients with spontaneous superficial intracerebral haemorrhage without intraventricular haemorrhage. ?? 2013 Mendelow et al.

This 65-year-old Caucasian male suffered an episode of bradycardia progressing to transient asystole during the course of an awake-craniotomy procedure for tumor resection. The cardiac rhythm changes resolved with administration of intravenous atropine, removal of the precipitating stimulus, and application of topical anesthetic on the dura of the middle cranial fossa. The trigeminocardiac response may complicate the course of a craniotomy and may place an awake, unintubated patient at increased risk for morbidity. The reflex may be prevented by anesthetizing the dura innervated by the trigeminal nerve via injection or topical application of local anesthetic. If encountered, removal of the stimulus, airway protection, and administration of vagolytic medications are measures that need to be considered.},

In this white paper, we describe Neuralink's first steps toward a scalable high-bandwidth BMI system. We have built arrays of small and flexible electrode “threads”, with as many as 3,072 electrodes per array distributed across 96 threads. We have also built a neurosurgical robot capable of inserting six threads (192 electrodes) per minute. Each thread can be individually inserted into the brain with micron precision for avoidance of surface vasculature and targeting specific brain regions. The electrode array is packaged into a small implantable device that contains custom chips for low-power on-board amplification and digitization: the package for 3,072 channels occupies less than (23 × 18.5 × 2) mm3. A single USB-C cable provides full-bandwidth data streaming from the device, recording from all channels simultaneously. This system has achieved a spiking yield of up to 85.5 {\%} in chronically implanted electrodes. Neuralink's approach to BMI has unprecedented packaging density and scalability in a clinically relevant package.},

This approach may be used for acoustic neuromas of all sizes, from intracanalicular, to more than 4 cm from the porus acusticus. Hearing preservation may be attempted and is generally successful in a substantial minority of cases. The facial nerve is readily visualized at the lateral end of the IAC and is at no greater risk than in the translabyrinthine operation.

abstract = {Periventricular nodular heterotopias (PNHs) are frequently associated with pharmacoresistant epilepsy. They are considered part of a dysfunctional network, connected to the overlying cortex. Therefore, removal of the PNHs and additional cortectomy or lobectomy seem to be essential for significant and long-lasting seizure reduction. These procedures, however, can have considerable limitations, especially in patients with functional eloquent cortex adjacent to the PNH. Alternatively, stereotactic neurosurgery can reduce the surgical trauma. Presented is a 56-year-old man who became seizure-free after stereotactically guided radiofrequency lesioning of a solitary PNH.},

abstract = {Primate studies have recently identified the dorsal stream as constituting multiple dissociable pathways associated with a range of specialized cognitive functions. To elucidate the nature and number of dorsal pathways in the human brain, the current study utilized in vivo probabilistic tractography to map the structural connectivity associated with subdivisions of the left supramarginal gyrus (SMG). The left SMG is a prominent region within the dorsal stream, which has recently been parcellated into five structurally-distinct regions which possess a dorsal-ventral (and rostral-caudal) organisation, postulated to reflect areas of functional specialisation. The connectivity patterns reveal a dissociation of the arcuate fasciculus into at least two segregated pathways connecting frontal-parietal-temporal regions. Specifically, the connectivity of the inferior SMG, implicated as an acoustic-motor speech interface, is carried by an inner/ventro-dorsal arc of fibres, whilst the pathways of the posterior superior SMG, implicated in object use and cognitive control, forms a parallel outer/dorso-dorsal crescent. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {A prospective study of 70 patients with intraparenchymal brain lesions (36 gliomas and 34 metastases) was performed to evaluate the efficacy of intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) in localizing and defining the borders of tumors and in assessing the extent of their resection. Eighteen of the 36 glioma patients had no previous therapy. All of these 18 tumors were well localized by IOUS; margins were well defined in 15 and moderately defined in three. The extent of resection was well defined on IOUS in all 18 patients, as confirmed by measurements taken on postoperative magnetic resonance (MR) images (p = 0.90). The remaining 18 patients with gliomas had undergone previous surgery and/or radiation therapy; five had recurrent tumors and 13 had radiation-induced changes. The extent of resection of the recurrent tumors was well defined in all but one patient, as confirmed by postoperative MR imaging. The extent of resection was poorly defined in all 13 patients whose pathology showed radiation effects. All 34 metastatic lesions were well localized and had well-defined margins. In addition, IOUS accurately determined the extent of resection in all cases, the results were confirmed with postoperative MR imaging. In conclusion, IOUS is not only helpful in localizing and defining the margins of gliomas and metastatic brain lesions, it also accurately determines the extent of resection, as confirmed by postoperative MR imaging. This assessment does not apply, however when the lesion is due primarily to radiation effect.},

abstract = {OBJECT Radiofrequency thermocoagulation (RF-TC) of presumed epileptogenic lesions and/or structures has gained new popularity as a treatment option for drug-resistant focal epilepsy, mainly in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. The role of this minimally invasive procedure in more complex cases of drug-resistant epilepsy, which may require intracranial electroencephalographic evaluation, has not been fully assessed. This retrospective study reports on a case series of patients with particularly complex focal epilepsy who underwent stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) evaluation with stereotactically implanted multicontact intracerebral electrodes for the detailed identification of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) and who received RF-TC in their supposed EZ (according to SEEG findings). METHODS Eighty-nine patients (49 male and 40 female; age range 2-49 years) who underwent SEEG evaluation and subsequent RF-TC of the presumed EZ at the authors' institution between January 2008 and December 2013 were selected. Brain MRI revealed structural abnormalities in 43 cases and no lesions in 46 cases. After SEEG, 67 patients were judged suitable for resective surgery (Group 1), whereas surgery was excluded for 22 patients (Group 2). Thermocoagulation was performed in each of these patients by using the previously implanted multicontact recording electrodes and delivering RF-generated currents to adjacent electrode contacts. RESULTS The mean number of TC sites per patient was 10.6 ± 7.2 (range 1-33). Sustained seizure freedom occurred after TC in 16 patients (18.0{\%}) (13 in Group 1 and 3 in Group 2). A sustained worthwhile improvement was reported by 9 additional patients (10.1{\%}) (3 in Group 1 and 6 in Group 2). As a whole, 25 patients (28.1{\%}) exhibited a persistent significant improvement in their seizures. More favorable results were observed in patients with nodular heterotopy (p = 0.0001389), those with a lesion found on MRI (not significant), and those with hippocampal sclerosis (not significant). Other variables significantly correlated to seizure freedom were the patient's age (p = 0.02885) and number of intralesional TC sites (p = 0.0271). The patients in Group 1 who did not benefit at all (21 patients) or who experienced only a transient benefit (30 patients) from TC underwent microsurgical resection of their EZ. Thermocoagulation was followed by severe permanent neurological deficits in 2 patients (an unexpected complex neuropsychological syndrome in one patient and an expected and anticipated permanent motor deficit in the other). CONCLUSIONS This study provides evidence that SEEG-guided TC in the EZ may be a treatment option for particularly complex drug-resistant focal epilepsy that requires invasive evaluation. A small subset of patients who achieve seizure freedom or worthwhile improvement may avoid open surgery or take advantage of an otherwise unexpected treatment if resection is not an option. Patients with epileptogenic nodular heterotopy are probably ideal candidates for this treatment.},

abstract = {Background context: Intracranial hypotension (IH) is a syndrome in which volume depletion of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) results in various neurological symptoms. Most commonly, a small tear or defect in the spinal dural sac is the underlying lesion that results in a CSF leakage and IH. Causes of IH can be classified as 1) spontaneous (primary), and 2) secondary. Knowledge of IH is essential to spine surgeons, because a small proportion of patients with spontaneous IH require spine surgery, and secondary causes of IH include spine trauma, various spine-related diagnostic/therapeutic procedures (iatrogenic), and degenerative spine disorders. Purpose: The purpose of this review is to update knowledge of IH pertinent to spine surgery. Study design/setting: Review of the literature. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PUBMED. The literature regarding IH with spinal pathology published from 1966 to 2005 was searched and reviewed comprehensively. Results/conclusions: The lower cervical and upper thoracic spine are the predilection sites for a CSF leak in patients with spontaneous IH. Mechanical stress may have a role in the pathogenesis of spontaneous IH, and meningeal diverticula and connective tissue disorders may be important risk factors. Iatrogenic causes of IH include lumbar puncture, spine surgery, and chiropractic manipulation. Rarely, degenerative spine disorders are the secondary cause of IH. Although orthostatic headache is the characteristic symptom of IH, a small proportion of patients present with neck pain or radicular symptoms of the upper extremity. Imaging studies of the spine have contributed significantly to elucidation of the pathophysiology of IH as well as identification of the site of a CSF leak. Typical spinal radiographic findings of IH include extra-arachnoid or extradural fluid collections, meningeal enhancement, engorgement of the epidural venous plexus, and tonsilar descent into the foramen magnum. Most patients with spontaneous IH respond favorably to conservative management, including autologous epidural blood patch. Surgical intervention is reserved for those who fail the conservative management. Although immediate clinical improvement is usually achieved by surgery, the long-term outcomes of surgical patients need to be investigated further. In patients who have a secondary cause of IH, treatment of the underlying lesion or condition may terminate a CSF leak and result in reversal of symptoms. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

However, this technique is based on empiric knowledge. The aim of this study is 3-fold: 1) provide in vivo animal data concerning the effect of bipolar RF-TC on brain and its safety; 2) assess the parameters of this procedure (current delivery and dipole selection) that produce the most efficient lesion; and 3) provide technical guidelines. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS$\backslash$nFirst we achieved in vivo RF-TC on rabbit brains with several conditions (power delivered and lesioning duration) and analyzed their influence on the lesion produced. Only a difference in terms of volume was found, and type of histologic lesions was similar whatever the settings were. We then performed multiple RF-TC in vitro on egg albumen, first with several parameters of radiofrequency and then with different dipole spatial selections. The end point was the size of the radiofrequency thermolesion produced. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS$\backslash$nUsing unfixed parameters of radiofrequency current delivery and increasing it until the power delivered by the generator collapsed produced significantly larger lesions (P = 0.008) than other conditions. Concerning the dipole selection, the use of contiguous contacts on electrodes led to lesions with a higher volume (P = 7.7 × 10−13) than those produced with noncontiguous ones. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION$\backslash$nBesides the target selection in SEEG RF-TC, which is summarized on the basis of a literature review, we report the optimal parameters: Radiofrequency current must be increased until the power delivered collapses, and dipoles should be constituted by contiguous electrode contacts.},

METHODS: Seventy-two (60{\%}) patients have been treated by hybrid instrumentation with lumbar and thoracic screws, hooks and wires at thoracic levels, while the remaining 48 (40{\%}) patients have used only lumbar and thoracic pedicle screws. Mean Cobb grades value of the main scoliotic curve was 73° before surgery in patients treated by hybrid instrumentation, reduced to 37.5° after surgery. In patients treated only by screws, mean Cobb grades value of the main scoliotic curve was 65°, reduced to 16° after surgery. RESULTS: Minimum follow up has been 3 years; mean patient age at surgery was 15 years and 4 months. We placed a total number of 1,004 pedicle screws, 487 of which at thoracic level. In 12 patients (10{\%}) a total number of 20 screws were misplaced at postoperatory exam, without any clinical complication for the patients or consequences on the arthrodesis or on maintaining the correction of the curve. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience pedicle screws is the method that leads to best correction and balance on vertebral bodies, with best results at distance concerning correction maintaining. Our experience shows that even at thoracic level, pedicle screws insertion by free-hand technique is safe and reliable.},

abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides a measure of the directional diffusion of water molecules in tissues. The measurement of DTI indexes within the spinal cord provides a quantitative assessment of neural damage in various spinal cord pathologies. DTI studies in animal models of spinal cord injury indicate that DTI is a reliable imaging technique with important histological and functional correlates. These studies demonstrate that DTI is a noninvasive marker of microstructural change within the spinal cord. In human studies, spinal cord DTI shows definite changes in subjects with acute and chronic spinal cord injury, as well as cervical spondylotic myelopathy. Interestingly, changes in DTI indexes are visualized in regions of the cord, which appear normal on conventional magnetic resonance imaging and are remote from the site of cord compression. Spinal cord DTI provides data that can help us understand underlying microstructural changes within the cord and assist in prognostication and planning of therapies. In this article, we review the use of DTI to investigate spinal cord pathology in animals and humans and describe advances in this technique that establish DTI as a promising biomarker for spinal cord disorders.},

DTI was performed with a 1.5 T MR scanner. Three hundred and forty-nine spine segments from C2/C3 to C5/C6 were evaluated and divided into five groups according to the degree of spinal cord compression. The values of fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient at each level were calculated and their correlations with the degree of stenosis were analyzed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: FA values differed significantly (p {\textless} 0.0001) at all levels between the control group and patients with cervical degenerative disease, including subjects without spinal cord compression visible on plain MR images. A significant (p {\textless} 0.01) positive correlation between the mean FA values and anteroposterior diameter of the spinal canal as well as space available for the spinal cord index was demonstrated at all investigated levels.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: DTI is capable of revealing impairment of the cervical spinal cord microstructure at the very early stage of degenerative spine disease, even prior to spinal cord compression visible on plain MR.

Triggered EMG had been found to be a more sensitive test to detect this breakthrough.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Seven patients who underwent the insertion of 103 pedicle screws were evaluated. The triggered EMG activity was recorded from several muscles depending on the level of screw placement. The postoperative CT scans were read by a spine surgeon who was a senior fellow in orthopedics, and a musculoskeletal radiologist.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The mean age at surgery was 12.6 years (range, 11 to 17 years). The preoperative mean Cobb angle was 54.7° (range, 45 to 65°). There were 80 thoracic screws and 23 lumbar screws. All the screws had stimulation thresholds of ≥ 6 mA, except 3 screws with the stimulation threshold of {\textless} 6 mA. Ten screws (9.7{\%}) showed violation of the pedicle wall on the postoperative CT scans. Five screws penetrated medially and another five penetrated laterally. No postoperative neurologic complications were noted in any of the seven patients.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Measuring the stimulation threshold of triggered EMG helps to assess the pedicle screw placement. Pedicle screws that had stimulation threshold of ≥ 6 mA were safe, with 90.3{\%} reliability, as was assessed on the postoperative CT scans.},

abstract = {Sacral fractures are rare and seldom result in formation of a sacral pseudomeningocele. Treatment of these pseudomeningoceles usually consists of conservative management with flat bedrest or open operative management. The authors describe the case of a 55-year-old woman with an anterior sacral pseudomeningocele that was successfully treated using a lumbar drain for temporary continuous CSF drainage. The patient first presented to an outside institution several days after sacral trauma from an ice skating fall. Initial symptoms included throbbing headaches relieved by lying flat. Head and cervical spine CT demonstrated no abnormality. As symptoms worsened, she presented to another institution where MRI of the lumbar spine indicated sacral fracture with pseudomeningocele. The patient subsequently transferred to the authors' facility, where symptoms included headaches and occasional mild sacral pain. Given her headaches and the authors' concern for CSF leak, another head CT scan was performed. This revealed no subdural hematoma or other abnormality. A subsequent CT myelogram revealed an anterior sacral pseudomeningocele at S3-4 with an anterior irregular linear filling defect, likely representing torn dura. Treatment included placement of a lumbar drain (10 ml/hr) and flat bedrest. Resolution of the CSF leak occurred on postprocedure Day 9. At the 4-week follow-up visit, the patient had no clinical symptoms of CSF leak and no neurological complaints. To our knowledge, this is the first description of temporary continuous CSF drainage used to treat a posttraumatic sacral pseudomeningocele. This technique may reduce the need for potentially complicated surgical repair of sacral fractures associated with CSF leak in select patients.},

abstract = {Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is a common disorder involving chronic progressive compression of the cervical spinal cord due to degenerative disc disease, spondylosis, or other degenerative pathology. CSM is the most common form of spinal cord impairment and causes functional decline leading to reduced independence and quality of life. Despite a sound understanding of the disease process, clinical presentation and management, a universal definition of CSM and a standardized index of severity are not currently used universally. Work is required to develop a definition and establish clinical predictors of progression to improve management of CSM. Despite advances in decompressive and reconstructive surgery, patients are often left with residual disability. Gaps in knowledge of the pathobiology of CSM have limited therapeutic advances to complement surgery. Although the histopathologic and pathophysiologic similarities between CSM and traumatic spinal cord injury have long been acknowledged, the unique pathomechanisms of CSM remain unexplored. Increased efforts to elucidate CSM pathobiology could lead to the discovery of novel therapeutic targets for human CSM and other spinal cord diseases. Here, the natural history of CSM, epidemiology, clinical presentation, and current methods of clinical management are reported, along with the current state of basic scientific research in the field.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To analyze the surgical outcome and safety of posterior quadrant disconnection in medically refractory epilepsy arising from the posterior head region from a level IV tertiary care center over a period of three years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven consecutive patients who underwent posterior quadrant disconnection for refractory epilepsy were analyzed. RESULTS: We analyzed the data of seven (n = 7) consecutive posterior quadrant epilepsy patients who underwent posterior quadrant disconnection with a mean age of 8.5 years over the last three years of which 4 were male and 3 females. All patients underwent extensive pre-surgical evaluation including detailed history, examination, prolonged video EEG recordings, neuropsychological testing, MRI brain, DTI, PET scan (n = 6), fMRI (n = 4), WADA test (n = 1) and invasive recording (n = 1), Of seven patients four had left sided pathology and three had right sided pathology. All patients except one underwent pure disconnection and one underwent partial resection. CONCLUSION: Posterior quadrant disconnection is effective surgical procedure for medically refractory epilepsy arising from the posterior quadrant in carefully selected patients without morbidity or functional disability across various age groups especially in children. In our series, all seven patient had good seizure outcome and none had functional disabilities.},

abstract = {In spite of advancements in neuro-imaging and microsurgical techniques, surgery for intramedullary spinal cord tumors (ISCT) remains a challenging task. The rationale for using intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IOM) is in keeping with the goal of maximizing tumor resection and minimizing neurological morbidity. For many years, before the advent of motor evoked potentials (MEPs), only somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were monitored. However, SEPs are not aimed to reflect the functional integrity of motor pathways and, nowadays, the combined used of SEPs and MEPs in ISCT surgery is almost mandatory because of the possibility to selectively injury either the somatosensory or the motor pathways. This paper is aimed to review our perspective in the field of IOM during ISCT surgery and to discuss it in the light of other intraoperative neurophysiologic strategies that have recently appeared in the literature with regards to ISCT surgery. Besides standard cortical SEP monitoring after peripheral stimulation, both muscle (mMEPs) and epidural MEPs (D-wave) are monitored after transcranial electrical stimulation (TES). Given the dorsal approach to the spinal cord, SEPs must be monitored continuously during the incision of the dorsal midline. When the surgeon starts to work on the cleavage plane between tumor and spinal cord, attention must be paid to MEPs. During tumor removal, we alternatively monitor D-wave and mMEPs, sustaining the stimulation during the most critical steps of the procedure. D-waves, obtained through a single pulse TES technique, allow a semi-quantitative assessment of the functional integrity of the cortico-spinal tracts and represent the strongest predictor of motor outcome. Whenever evoked potentials deteriorate, temporarily stop surgery, warm saline irrigation and improved blood perfusion have proved useful for promoting recovery, Most of intraoperative neurophysiological derangements are reversible and therefore IOM is able to prevent more than merely predict neurological injury. In our opinion combining mMEPs and D-wave monitoring, when available, is the gold standard for ISCT surgery because it supports a more aggressive surgery in the attempt to achieve a complete tumor removal. If quantitative (threshold or waveform dependent) mMEPs criteria only are used to stop surgery, this likely impacts unfavorably on the rate of tumor removal.},

abstract = {Intraoperative brain mapping has the goal of aiding with maximal surgical resection of brain tumors while minimizing functional sequelae. Retrospective randomized studies on large populations have shown that this technique can optimize the surgical approach while reducing postoperative morbidity. During direct electrical stimulation of the language areas adjacent to the tumor, the patient should be collaborative and be able to speak to participate in language testing. Different anesthesiological protocols have been proposed to allow intraoperative brain mapping, which range from local anesthesia to conscious sedation or general anesthesia, with or without airway instrumentation. The most common intraoperative complications are seizure, respiratory depression, and patients' stress and discomfort. Since awake craniotomy carries both benefits and potential risks, the following factors are crucial in the management of patients: 1) careful selection of the patients and 2) communication between the anesthesiological and surgical teams. To date, there remains no consensus about the optimal anesthesiological regimen to use. Only prospective, multicentre randomized studies focused on evaluating the role of different anesthesiological techniques on intraoperative monitoring, postoperative deficits, and intraoperative complications can answer the question of which anesthesiological approach should be chosen when intraoperative brain mapping is requested.},

abstract = {Diffuse WHO grade II gliomas are diffusively infiltrative brain tumors characterized by an unavoidable anaplastic transformation. Their management is strongly dependent on their location in the brain due to interactions with functional regions and potential differences in molecular biology. In this paper, we present the construction of a probabilistic atlas mapping the preferential locations of diffuse WHO grade II gliomas in the brain. This is carried out through a sparse graph whose nodes correspond to clusters of tumors clustered together based on their spatial proximity. The interest of such an atlas is illustrated via two applications. The first one correlates tumor location with the patient's age via a statistical analysis, highlighting the interest of the atlas for studying the origins and behavior of the tumors. The second exploits the fact that the tumors have preferential locations for automatic segmentation. Through a coupled decomposed Markov Random Field model, the atlas guides the segmentation process, and characterizes which preferential location the tumor belongs to and consequently which behavior it could be associated to. Leave-one-out cross validation experiments on a large database highlight the robustness of the graph, and yield promising segmentation results.},

Multiple etiologies are associated with ICH, for example, hypertension, Alzheimer's disease, vascular malformations and coagulopathies (genetic or drug-induced). After the initial bleed, there can be continued bleeding over the first 24 hours, so-called hematoma expansion, which is associated with adverse outcomes. A number of clinical trials are focused on trying to limit such expansion. Significant progress has been made on the causes of BBB dysfunction after ICH at the molecular and cell signaling level. Blood components (e.g. thrombin, hemoglobin, iron) and the inflammatory response to those components play a large role in ICH-induced BBB dysfunction. There are current clinical trials of minimally invasive hematoma removal and iron chelation which may limit such dysfunction. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the initial hemorrhage and secondary BBB dysfunction in ICH is vital for developing methods to prevent and treat this devastating form of stroke.},

This study attempted to obtain individual patient data from each of the 13 studies published since 1985 to better define groups of patients that might benefit from surgery.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Authors of identified published articles were approached by mail, e-mail, and at conferences and invited to take part in the study. Data were obtained from 8 studies (2186 cases). Individual patient data included patient's age, Glasgow Coma Score at presentation, volume and site of hematoma, presence of intraventricular hemorrhage, method of evacuation, time to randomization, and outcome.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Meta-analysis indicated that there was improved outcome with surgery if randomization was [corrected] undertaken within 8 hours of ictus (P=0.003), or the volume of the hematoma was 20 to 50 mL (P=0.004), or the Glasgow Coma Score was between 9 and 12 (P=0.0009), or the patient was aged between 50 and 69 years (P=0.01). In addition, there was some evidence that more superficial hematomas with no intraventricular hemorrhage might also benefit (P=0.09).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: There is evidence that surgery is of benefit if undertaken early before the patient deteriorates. This work identifies areas for further research. Ongoing studies in subgroups of patients such as the Surgical Trial in Lobar Intracerebral Hemorrhage (STICH II) will confirm whether these interpretations can be replicated.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The value of intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (INM) during intramedullary spinal cord tumor surgery remains debated. This historical control study tests the hypothesis that INM monitoring improves neurological outcome. METHODS: In 50 patients operated on after September 2000, we monitored somatosensory evoked potentials and transcranially elicited epidural (D-wave) and muscle motor evoked potentials (INM group). The historical control group consisted of 50 patients selected from among 301 patients who underwent intramedullary spinal cord tumor surgery, previously operated on by the same team without INM. Matching by preoperative neurological status (McCormick scale), histological findings, tumor location, and extent of removal were blind to outcome. A more than 50{\%} somatosensory evoked potential amplitude decrement influenced only myelotomy. Muscle motor evoked potential disappearance modified surgery, but more than 50{\%} D-wave amplitude decrement was the major indication to stop surgery. The postoperative to preoperative McCormick grade variation at discharge and at a follow-up of at least 3 months was compared between the two groups (Student's t tests). RESULTS: Follow-up McCormick grade variation in the INM group (mean, +0.28) was significantly better (P = 0.0016) than that of the historical control group (mean, -0.16). At discharge, there was a trend (P = 0.1224) toward better McCormick grade variation in the INM group (mean, -0.26) than in the historical control group (mean, -0.5). CONCLUSION: The applied motor evoked potential methods seem to improve long-term motor outcome significantly. Early motor outcome is similar because of transient motor deficits in the INM group, which can be predicted at the end of surgery by the neurophysiological profile of patients.},

This technique implements anatomic landmarks and tactile palpation without fluoroscopy or navigation to place thoracic pedicle screws. Because this technique is performed by surgeons in training, we wished to analyze the rate at which these screws were properly placed by residents by retrospectively reviewing the accuracy of resident-placed free-hand thoracic pedicle screws using computed tomography imaging. A total of 268 resident-placed thoracic pedicle screws was analyzed using axial computed tomography by an independent attending neuroradiologist. Eighty-five percent of the screws were completely within the pedicle and that 15{\%} of the screws violated the pedicle cortex. The majority of the breaches were lateral breaches between 2 and 4 mm (46{\%}). There was no clinical evidence of neurovascular injury or injury to the esophagus. There were no re-operations for screw replacement. We concluded that under appropriate supervision, neurosurgery residents can safely place free-hand thoracic pedicle screws with an acceptable breach rate.},

Neurol Res. 2015 Apr 28;1743132815Y0000000041. e, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) from 1990-2008, we evaluated subjects with histologically confirmed spinal cord ependymoma. RESULTS: We identified 1,353 patients with spinal ependymoma (mean age 43.5 years). Among these, 26 had anaplastic ependymoma (AE), 374 had myxopapillary ependymoma (MPE), and 953 had other low-grade ependymoma (non-MPE). Median follow-up was 61 months. Overall survival at 5 years was 97{\%} for MPE, 92{\%} for low-grade non-MPE, and 73{\%} for AE. Gross total resection (GTR) was achieved in 58{\%} of subjects with MPE, 51{\%} with low-grade non-MPE, and 50{\%} with AE. Radiation occurred more often after subtotal resection (STR) than after GTR, and more often among those with anaplastic histology. Histology and extent of surgical resection were significant prognostic factors in multivariate analyses. Compared to MPE, subjects with low-grade non-MPE had a higher risk of mortality at 5 years (HR 2.35, P = 0.03), as did subjects with AE (HR 8.63, P {\textless} 0.01). Compared to GTR, STR was associated with an increased risk of mortality at 5 years (HR 2.2, P = 0.01), as was biopsy only (HR 2.05, P = 0.03) and no surgery (HR 4.97, P {\textless} 0.01). Among patients with either STR or GTR, adjuvant radiotherapy did not confer a survival benefit at 5 years (STR: HR 2.29, P = 0.07, and GTR: HR 2.2, P = 0.12). DISCUSSION: We found that lower grade histology and higher extent of surgical resection were significant prognostic factors for more favourable survival outcomes for spinal ependymoma patients.},

abstract = {Purpose Over the last few decades, preferred epilepsy surgical approaches have developed from standard lobectomies to individually tailored resections. Yet, it remains uncertain how small surgical interventions can be without compromising the success of the surgery. Particularly in patients with epileptogenic lesions identified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), it is unresolved whether resection or destruction of the lesion suffices to eliminate the epileptogenic zone. We present a minimally invasive surgical approach that may provide insight into this issue. Methods Two patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy due to focal cortical dysplasia type IIB demonstrated by 3 Tesla MRI were treated with lesion-focused stereotactic radio-frequency thermo-coagulation. In both patients, pathognomonic epileptic discharges were recorded from the lesion via a stimulation device prior to coagulation. In one patient, the suspected proximity of the lesion to the pyramidal tract was verified by eliciting motor evoked potentials from the depths of the lesion. Results Following complete and near complete lesion destruction, seizures (several per day or per week, respectively) ceased in patients A and B, with no seizures for 12 months and 5 months, respectively, at the time of this publication. Neither patient acquired persistent postoperative neurological deficits. Conclusion The fact that seizure activity stopped after destruction of small bottom-of-sulcus dysplasias implies that in these cases, the epileptogenic zone and the epileptogenic lesion may overlap. If future studies can replicate this finding, focused lesion destruction could be a further development of individually tailored epilepsy surgery. The technique described here is especially suited for high-precision surgery close to eloquent brain structures. ?? 2014 British Epilepsy Association.},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} 2016 by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons. Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is a common cause of spinal cord dysfunction that confronts clinicians on a daily basis. Research performed over the past few decades has provided improved insight into the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of this disorder. We aim to provide clinicians with an update regarding the state of the art in DCM, focusing on more recent research pertaining to pathophysiology, natural history, treatment, consideration of the minimally symptomatic patient, surgical outcome prediction, and outcome measurement. Current concepts of pathophysiology focus on the combination of static and dynamic elements leading to breakdown of the blood-spinal cord barrier at the site of compression resulting in local inflammation, cellular dysfunction, and apoptosis. With respect to treatment, although there is a dearth of high-quality studies comparing surgical to nonoperative treatment, several large prospective studies have recently associated surgical management with clinically and statistically significant improvement in functional, disability, and quality of life outcome at long-term follow-up. When selecting the specific surgical intervention for a patient with DCM, anterior (discectomy, corpectomy, hybrid discectomy/corpectomy), posterior (laminectomy and fusion, laminoplasty), and combined approaches may be considered as options depending on the specifics of the patient in question; evidence supporting each of these approaches is reviewed in detail. Recently developed clinical prediction models allow for accurate forecasting of postoperative outcomes, permitting enhanced communication and management of patient expectations in the preoperative setting. Finally, an overview of outcome measures recommended for use in the assessment of DCM patients is provided.},

abstract = {OBJECT The purpose of this study was to describe the location of each white matter pathway in the area between the inferior limiting insular sulcus (ILS) and temporal horn that may be crossed in approaches through the temporal stem to the medial temporal lobe. METHODS The fiber tracts in 14 adult cadaveric cerebral hemispheres were examined using the Klingler technique. The fiber dissections were completed in a stepwise manner, identifying each white matter pathway in different planes and describing its position in relation to the anterior end of the ILS. RESULTS The short-association fibers from the extreme capsule, which continue toward the operculae, are the most superficial subcortical layer deep to the ILS. The external capsule fibers are found deeper at an intermediate layer and are formed by the uncinate fasciculus, inferior frontooccipital fasciculus, and claustrocortical fibers in a sequential anteroposterior disposition. The anterior commissure forms the next deeper layer, and the optic radiations in the sublenticular part of the internal capsule represent the deepest layer. The uncinate fasciculus is found deep to the anterior third of the ILS, whereas the inferior frontooccipital fasciculus and optic radiations are found superficial and deep, respectively, at the posterior two-thirds of this length. CONCLUSIONS The authors' findings suggest that in the transsylvian approach, a 6-mm incision beginning just posterior to the limen insula through the ILS will cross the uncinate fasciculus but not the inferior frontooccipital fasciculus or optic radiations, but that longer incisions carry a risk to language and visual functions.},

abstract = {Purpose: To identify predictors of seizure recurrence following posterior quadrant epilepsy surgery. Methods: Between 1983 and 2008, 43 medically refractory epilepsy patients underwent posterior quadrant epilepsy surgery. Epilepsy surgery involved the occipital lobe in all cases; some cases also included resection of the adjacent parietal or temporal cortex. Using a logistic regression model, we evaluated the relationship between outcome (Engel class I-IV) and 5 outcome predictors: absence of a visual aura, a temporal lobe type aura, versive head movement unaccompanied by a visual aura, non-focal interictal scalp EEG, and surgical pathology other than low grade tumor or cortical dysplasia. We also determined the relative risk for significant post-operative cognitive decline of Wechsler intelligence test score among those receiving complete lobectomies compared to those receiving partial lobectomies. Results: Overall, outcome was favorable at 1 year following surgery: 22 (51.2{\%}) patients Engel class I, 10 (24{\%}) patients Engel class II, 5 (12{\%}) patients Engel class III, and 6 (14{\%}) patients Engel class IV. The 3 best univariate predictors of seizure recurrence were versive head movement unaccompanied by visual aura, non-focal interictal scalp EEG, and pathology other than low grade tumor or cortical dysplasia. A multivariate predictor combining temporal lobe type aura, versive head movement unaccompanied by visual aura, non-focal interictal scalp EEG, and pathology other than low grade tumor or cortical dysplasia was optimum. Complete lobectomy significantly increased the risk of post-operative decline of Wechsler intelligence score. Conclusions: These findings indicate that posterior quadrant epilepsy surgery may provide sustained seizure control. A multivariate model combining temporal lobe type aura, versive head movement unaccompanied by a visual aura, non-focal interictal scalp EEG, and pathology other than low grade tumor or cortical dysplasia may contribute to predicting seizure recurrence following posterior quadrant epilepsy surgery. The extent of cortical resection may predict significant cognitive decline in post-operative Wechsler intelligence score. ?? 2012 British Epilepsy Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Proximity to eloquent cortical regions often limits resectability and elevates the risk of surgery-related deficits. Therefore, functional localization of eloquent cortex or subcortical fiber tracts can enhance the EOR and functional outcome. Imaging techniques such as functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging fiber tracking, and neurophysiological methods like navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation and magnetoencephalography, make it possible to identify eloquent areas prior to resective surgery and to tailor indication and surgical approach but also to assess the surgical risk. Intraoperative monitoring with direct cortical stimulation and subcortical stimulation enables surgeons to preserve essential functional tissue during surgery. Through tailored pre- and intraoperative mapping and monitoring the EOR can be maximized, with reduced rates of surgery-related deficits.},

abstract = {Background: An anterior sacral meningocele is a rare form of spinal dysraphism that is sometimes associated with syndromes such as Currarino and Marfan syndromes. These lesions rarely cause neurological complications, but meningitis, sepsis, obstetric problems, and bowel and bladder difficulties are common secondary conditions. The lesions can even be fatal. Because these lesions usually do not regress spontaneously, surgical treatment is the standard for symptomatic or growing masses. The dural defect can be repaired with a variety of anterior or posterior approaches. Case Description: We present a case of a 16-year-old female patient with a giant nonsyndromic anterior sacral meningocele that we successfully treated using an open anterior approach. We discuss the treatment options and present a brief review of the literature. Conclusions: Although the posterior approach remains the treatment of choice for most lesions, we believe that the anterior laparotomy provides excellent exposure and is a safe alternative approach for the treatment of selected lesions. Patients with these lesions should be cared for by a multidisciplinary team. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Background: 5-aminolevulinic acid is a non-fluorescent prodrug that leads to intracellular accumulation of fluorescent porphyrins in malignant gliomas-a finding that is under investigation for intraoperative identification and resection of these tumours. We aimed to assess the effect of fluorescence-guided resection with 5-aminolevulinic acid on surgical radicality, progression-free survival, overall survival, and morbidity. Methods: 322 patients aged 23-73 years with suspected malignant glioma amenable to complete resection of contrast-enhancing tumour were randomly assigned to 20 mg/kg bodyweight 5-aminolevulinic acid for fluorescence-guided resection (n=161) or to conventional microsurgery with white light (n=161). The primary endpoints were the number of patients without contrast-enhancing tumour on early MRI (ie, that obtained within 72 h after surgery) and 6-month progression-free survival as assessed by MRI. Secondary endpoints were volume of residual tumour on postoperative MRI, overall survival, neurological deficit, and toxic effects. We report the results of an interim analysis with 270 patients in the full-analysis population (139 assigned 5-aminolevulinic acid, 131 assigned white light), which excluded patients with ineligible histological and radiological findings as assessed by central reviewers who were masked as to treatment allocation; the interim analysis resulted in termination of the study as defined by the protocol. Primary and secondary endpoints were analysed by intention to treat in the full-analysis population. The study is registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00241670. Findings: Median follow-up was 35{\textperiodcentered}4 months (95{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}0-56{\textperiodcentered}7). Contrast-enhancing tumour was resected completely in 90 (65{\%}) of 139 patients assigned 5-aminolevulinic acid compared with 47 (36{\%}) of 131 assigned white light (difference between groups 29{\%} [95{\%} CI 17-40], p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001). Patients allocated 5-aminolevulinic acid had higher 6-month progression free survival than did those allocated white light (41{\textperiodcentered}0{\%} [32{\textperiodcentered}8-49{\textperiodcentered}2] vs 21{\textperiodcentered}1{\%} [14{\textperiodcentered}0-28{\textperiodcentered}2]; difference between groups 19{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} [9{\textperiodcentered}1-30{\textperiodcentered}7], p=0{\textperiodcentered}0003, Z test). Groups did not differ in the frequency of severe adverse events or adverse events in any organ system class reported within 7 days after surgery. Interpretation: Tumour fluorescence derived from 5-aminolevulinic acid enables more complete resections of contrast-enhancing tumour, leading to improved progression-free survival in patients with malignant glioma. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Introduction: Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes partial or complete damage to sensory and motor pathways and induces immediate changes in cortical function. Current rehabilitative strategies do not address this early alteration, therefore impacting the degree of neuroplasticity and subsequent recovery. The following study aims to test if a non-invasive brain stimulation technique such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is effective in promoting plasticity and rehabilitation, and can be used as an early intervention strategy in a rat model of SCI. Methods: A contusion SCI was induced at segment T9 in adult rats. An rTMS coil was positioned over the brain to deliver high frequency stimulation. Behavior, motor and sensory functions were tested in three groups: SCI rats that received high-frequency (20 Hz) rTMS within 10 min post-injury (acute-TMS; n = 7); SCI rats that received TMS starting 2 weeks post-injury (chronic-TMS; n = 5), and SCI rats that received sham TMS (no-TMS, n = 5). Locomotion was evaluated by the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) and gridwalk tests. Motor evoked potentials (MEP) were recorded from the forepaw across all groups to measure integrity of motor pathways. Functional MRI (fMRI) responses to contralateral tactile hindlimb stimulation were measured in an 11.7T horizontal bore small-animal scanner. Results: The acute-TMS group demonstrated the fastest improvements in locomotor performance in both the BBB and gridwalk tests compared to chronic and no-TMS groups. MEP responses from forepaw showed significantly greater difference in the inter-peak latency between acute-TMS and no-TMS groups, suggesting increases in motor function. Finally, the acute-TMS group showed increased fMRI-evoked responses to hindlimb stimulation over the right and left hindlimb (LHL) primary somatosensory representations (S1), respectively; the chronic-TMS group showed moderate sensory responses in comparison, and the no-TMS group exhibited the lowest sensory responses to both hindlimbs. Conclusion: The results suggest that rTMS therapy beginning in the acute phase after SCI promotes neuroplasticity and is an effective rehabilitative approach in a rat model of SCI.},

For an adequate treatment strategy, an easy and reliable classification is needed. Methods: The working group "Osteoporotic Fractures" of the Spine Section of the German Society for Orthopaedics and Trauma (DGOU) has developed a classification system (OF classification) for osteoporotic thoracolumbar fractures. The consensus decision followed an established pathway including review of the current literature. Results: The OF classification consists of 5 groups: OF 1, no vertebral deformation (vertebral edema); OF 2, deformation with no or minor ({\textless}1/5) involvement of the posterior wall; OF 3, deformation with distinct involvement ({\textgreater}1/5) of the posterior wall; OF 4, loss of integrity of the vertebral frame or vertebral body collapse or pincer-type fracture; OF 5, injuries with distraction or rotation. The interobserver reliability was substantial (k ¼ .63). Conclusions: The proposed OF classification is easy to use and provides superior clinical differentiation of the typical osteo-porotic fracture morphologies.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Massachusetts Medical Society. BACKGROUND: Sciatica can be disabling, and evidence regarding medical treatments is limited. Pregabalin is effective in the treatment of some types of neuropathic pain. This study examined whether pregabalin may reduce the intensity of sciatica. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of pregabalin in patients with sciatica. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either pregabalin at a dose of 150 mg per day that was adjusted to a maximum dose of 600 mg per day or matching placebo for up to 8 weeks. The primary outcome was the leg-pain intensity score on a 10-point scale (with 0 indicating no pain and 10 the worst possible pain) at week 8; the leg-pain intensity score was also evaluated at week 52, a secondary time point for the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included the extent of disability, back-pain intensity, and quality-of-life measures at prespecified time points over the course of 1 year. RESULTS: A total of 209 patients underwent randomization, of whom 108 received pregabalin and 101 received placebo; after randomization, 2 patients in the pregabalin group were determined to be ineligible and were excluded from the analyses. At week 8, the mean unadjusted leg-pain intensity score was 3.7 in the pregabalin group and 3.1 in the placebo group (adjusted mean difference, 0.5; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], -0.2 to 1.2; P = 0.19). At week 52, the mean unadjusted leg-pain intensity score was 3.4 in the pregabalin group and 3.0 in the placebo group (adjusted mean difference, 0.3; 95{\%} CI, -0.5 to 1.0; P = 0.46). No significant between-group differences were observed with respect to any secondary outcome at either week 8 or week 52. A total of 227 adverse events were reported in the pregabalin group and 124 in the placebo group. Dizziness was more common in the pregabalin group than in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with pregabalin did not significantly reduce the intensity of leg pain associated with sciatica and did not significantly improve other outcomes, as compared with placebo, over the course of 8 weeks. The incidence of adverse events was significantly higher in the pregabalin group than in the placebo group.},

The current status of the classification of hydrocephalus in individual subgroups was reviewed and summarized from publications in the last 60 years (1950-2010), and discussed focusing on the variety of characteristics in hydrocephalus, with more and more new aspects recently disclosed not only in fetal and pediatric but also in adult hydrocephalus.

Five men (12.5{\%}) and 35 women (87.5{\%}) (mean age 34.5 +/- 10.9 years) underwent 52 operations for 41 tumors. The mean follow-up duration was 82 +/- 93 months (range 0-445 months).

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Stereo electroencephalography (SEEG)-guided radiofrequency thermocoagulation (SEEG-guided RF-TC) has been proposed since 2004 as a possible treatment of some focal drug-resistant epilepsy. The aim of this study is to provide extensive data about efficacy and safety of SEEG-guided RF-TC. METHODS: Over a 10-year period, 162 patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy were eligible for SEEG-guided RF-TG during phase II invasive investigation by SEEG. All follow-up and safety data were collected prospectively. The primary outcome was seizure freedom at 2 months and at 1 year after SEEG-guided RF-TC. Secondary outcomes were the responders' rate (patient with at least 50{\%} decrease in seizure frequency) and their long-term follow-up. RESULTS: Twenty-five percent of patients were seizure-free at 2 months and 7{\%} at 1 year. We reported 67{\%} of responders at 2 months and 48{\%} at 1 year; 58{\%} of responders maintained their status during the long-term follow-up. The seizure outcome was significantly better when the SEEG-guided RF-TC involved the occipital region (p = 0.007). When surgery followed an SEEG-guided RF-TC, the positive predictive value of being a responder 2 months after an SEEG-guided RF-TC and to be Engel's class I or II after surgery was 93{\%}. We reported 1.1{\%} of permanent deficit and 2.4{\%} of transient side effects. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results, gathered in a large population over a 10-year period, confirm that SEEG-guided RF-TC is a safe technique, being efficient in many cases. More than two thirds of patients showed a short-term improvement, and almost half of them were responders at 1-year follow-up. The technique appears to be especially interesting for limited epileptic zone inaccessible to surgery and when epilepsy is related to a large unilateral network (network disruption by multiple RF-TC). Furthermore, SEEG-guided RF-TC effect is a predictor of outcome after conventional cortectomy in patients eligible for surgery.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of heavily T2-weighted magnetic resonance myelography (MRM) in patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH). METHODS: Patients with SIH were recruited prospectively, and first underwent MRM and then computed tomographic myelography (CTM). The results of MRM were validated with the gold standard, CTM, focusing on 1) CSF leaks along the nerve roots, 2) epidural CSF collections, and 3) high-cervical (C1-3) retrospinal CSF collections. Comparisons of these 3 findings between the 2 studies were made by kappa statistics and agreement rates. Targeted epidural blood patches (EBPs) were placed at the levels of CSF leaks if supportive treatment failed. RESULTS: Nineteen patients (6 men and 13 women, mean age 37.9 +/- 8.6 years) with SIH completed the study. MRM did not differ from CTM in the detection rates of CSF leaks along the nerve roots (84{\%} vs 74{\%}, p = 0.23), high-cervical retrospinal CSF collections (32{\%} vs 16{\%}, p = 0.13), and epidural CSF collections (89{\%} vs 79{\%}, p = 0.20). MRM demonstrated more spinal levels of CSF leaks (2.2 +/- 1.7 vs 1.5 +/- 1.5, p = 0.011) and epidural collections (12.2 +/- 5.9 vs 7.1 +/- 5.8, p {\textless} 0.001) than CTM. The overall level-by-level concordance was substantial for CSF leaks along the nerve roots (C1-L3) (kappa = 0.71, p {\textless} 0.001, agreement = 95{\%}) and high-cervical retrospinal CSF collections (C1-3) (kappa = 0.73, p {\textless} 0.001, agreement = 92{\%}), and moderate for epidural CSF collections (C1-L3) (kappa = 0.47, p {\textless} 0.001, agreement = 72{\%}). Ten of the 14 patients (71{\%}) receiving targeted EBPs experienced sustained symptomatic relief after a single attempt. CONCLUSIONS: Heavily T2-weighted magnetic resonance myelography was accurate in localizing CSF leaks for patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension. This noninvasive technique may be an alternative to computed tomographic myelography before targeted epidural blood patches.},

abstract = {Object The etiology of chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) in nongeriatric patients (≤ 60 years old) often remains unclear. The primary objective of this study was to identify spinal CSF leaks in young patients, after formulating the hypothesis that spinal CSF leaks are causally related to CSDH. Methods All consecutive patients 60 years of age or younger who underwent operations for CSDH between September 2009 and April 2011 at Bern University Hospital were included in this prospective cohort study. The patient workup included an extended search for a spinal CSF leak using a systematic algorithm: MRI of the spinal axis with or without intrathecal contrast application, myelography/fluoroscopy, and postmyelography CT. Spinal pathologies were classified according to direct proof of CSF outflow from the intrathecal to the extrathecal space, presence of extrathecal fluid accumulation, presence of spinal meningeal cysts, or no pathological findings. The primary outcome was proof of a CSF leak. Results Twenty-seven patients, with a mean age of 49.6 ± 9.2 years, underwent operations for CSDH. Hematomas were unilateral in 20 patients and bilateral in 7 patients. In 7 (25.9{\%}) of 27 patients, spinal CSF leakage was proven, in 9 patients (33.3{\%}) spinal meningeal cysts in the cervicothoracic region were found, and 3 patients (11.1{\%}) had spinal cysts in the sacral region. The remaining 8 patients (29.6{\%}) showed no pathological findings. Conclusions The direct proof of spinal CSF leakage in 25.9{\%} of patients suggests that spinal CSF leaks may be a frequent cause of nongeriatric CSDH.},

abstract = {Objective: Neuroimaging studies have suggested an evolution of the brain activation pattern in the course of motor recovery after stroke. Initially poor motor performance is correlated with an recruitment of the uninjured hemisphere that continuously vanished until a nearly normal (contralateral) activation pattern is achieved and motor performance is good. Here we were interested in the early brain activation pattern in patients who showed a good and rapid recovery after stroke. Methods: Ten patients with first-ever ischemic stroke affecting motor areas had to perform self-paced simple or more complex movements with the affected or the unaffected hand during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The location and number of activated voxels above threshold were determined. To study possible changes in the cortical motor output map the amplitude of the motor evoked potentials (MEP) and the extent of the excitable area were determined using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Results: The pattern of activation observed with movements of the affected and the unaffected hand was similar. In the simple motor task significant (P{\textless}0.05) increases were found in the primary motor cortex ipsilateral to the movement, the supplementary motor area and the cerebellar hemisphere contralateral to the movement during performance with the affected hand compared to movements with the unaffected hand. When comparing simple with more complex movements performed with either the affected or the unaffected hand, a further tendency to increased activation in motor areas was observed. The amplitude of MEPs obtained from the affected hemisphere was smaller and the extent of cortical output maps was decreased compared to the unaffected hemisphere; but none of the patients showed MEPs at the affected hand when the ipsilateral unaffected motor cortex was stimulated. Conclusions: Despite a rapid and nearly complete motor recovery the brain activation pattern was associated with increased activity in (bilateral) motor areas as revealed with fMRI. TMS revealed impaired motor output properties, but failed to demonstrate ipsilateral motor pathways. Successful recovery in our patients may therefore rely on the increased bilateral activation of existing motor networks spared by the injury. {\textcopyright} 2003 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) results from leaks developing in the dura mater. The major symptom is orthostatic headache which gradually disappears after lying down. Lumbar epidural blood patches (EBPs) can be effective in relieving headaches, however, thoracic and cervical EBPs have also been applied to alleviate the symptoms. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS Retrospective collection of the main characteristics of SIH, site and amount of blood injection, and clinical outcomes of 18 patients who underwent thoracic EBPs for intractable SIH. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective case series RESULTS: All thoracic autologous EBPs except 3 were performed in the sitting position. Patients undergoing epidural puncture at lower thoracic levels (T10-T12) received 25 mL of autologous blood, 15 mL and 18 mL were injected at spinal segments T5-T7 (mid-thoracic) and T2-T4 (upper- thoracic), respectively. Thoracic EBPs did not lead to immediate resolution of symptoms in 3 of 18 patients; one of them underwent early repetition with complete headache relief, one refused a second EBP, and one experienced partial resolution, followed by a recurrence, and then satisfactory improvement with a second high thoracic EBP. In long-term follow-up only 2 patients complained of symptoms or relapses. LIMITATIONS Retrospective nature of the case series, single center experience. CONCLUSIONS Performing thoracic-targeted EBPs as the preferred approach theoretically improves results with respect to those observed with lumbar EBPs. The immediate response was comparable with that of other reports, but the long-term success rate (90{\%}) turned out to be very effective in terms of both quality of headache relief and very low incidence of recurrence.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Radical excision of parenchymal brain tumours is generally associated with a better long-term outcome; however, it is difficult to ascertain the extent of resection at surgery. We used intra-operative ultrasound [IOUS] to help detect residual tumour and define the tumour-brain interface. METHODS: Thirty-five patients with parenchymal brain lesions including 11 low-grade and 22 high-grade tumours and 2 inflammatory granulomata were included in the study. The IOUS was used to localize tumours not seen on the surface, define their margins and assess the extent of resection at the end of surgery. Multiple samples from the tumour-brain interface which were reported as tumour or normal tissue on IOUS were submitted to histopathology. The IOUS findings were compared with a postoperative contrast enhanced computed tomogram [CT] and with histopathology. RESULTS: All tumours irrespective of histology were hyperechoic on IOUS. IOUS was useful in localizing those tumours not seen on the surface of the brain. In 71.4{\%} of cases IOUS was useful in defining their margins, however in the remaining cases the margins were ill-defined. The tumour margins were ill-defined in those treated previously by radiation. With regard to the extent of excision, after excluding the cases who were irradiated, it was found that in the 28 patients who had parenchymal neoplasms, there was concordance between the ultrasound findings and the postoperative CT scan in 23 cases. Of the 79 samples taken from the tumor-brain interface which were reported as tumour on ultrasound, 66 had histopathological evidence of tumour while 13 samples were negative for tumour. On the other hand, in the tissue sent from 17 sites where the IOUS showed no residual tumour, 2 were positive for tumour on histopathology while 15 were negative. INTERPRETATION: In conclusion, IOUS is a cheap and useful real-time tool for localizing tumours not seen on the brain surface, for defining their margins and for determining the extent of resection.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) is a procedure performed for patients with intractable epilepsy in order to anatomically define the epileptogenic zone (EZ) and the possible related functional cortical areas. By avoiding the need for large craniotomies and due to its intrinsic precision placement features, SEEG may be associated with fewer complications. Nevertheless, intracerebral electrodes have gained a reputation of excessive invasiveness, with a "relatively high morbidity" associated with their placement. A systematic literature review and meta-analysis of SEEG complications has not been previously performed. The goal of this study is to quantitatively review the incidence of various surgical complications associated with SEEG electrode implantation in the literature and to provide a summary estimate. This will allow physicians to accurately counsel their patients about the potential complications related to this method of extraoperative invasive monitoring. METHODS The systematic review was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). We conducted MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science database searches with the search algorithm. We analyzed complication rates using a fixed-effects model with inverse variance weighting. Calculations for the meta-analysis and construction of forest plots were completed using an established spreadsheet. The principal summary measures were the effect summary value and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS The initial 1,901 retrieved citations were reviewed. After removing 787 duplicates, the titles and abstracts of 1,114 publications were screened. At this stage, studies that did not mention the absence or presence of complications following SEEG or that did not fulfill the inclusion criteria in any manner were excluded. After excluding 1,057 citations, the full text was assessed in the resulting 57 articles for eligibility criteria. The most common complications were hemorrhagic (pooled prevalence 1.0{\%}, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 0.6-1.4{\%}) or infectious (pooled prevalence 0.8{\%}, 95{\%} CI 0.3-1.2{\%}). Five mortalities were identified (pooled prevalence 0.3{\%}, 95{\%} CI -0.1-0.6{\%}). Overall, our analysis identified 121 surgical complications related to SEEG insertion and monitoring (pooled prevalence 1.3{\%}, 95{\%} CI 0.9-1.7{\%}). SIGNIFICANCE This review represents a comprehensive estimation of the actual incidence of complications related to SEEG. We report a rate substantially lower than the complication rates reported for other methods of extraoperative invasive monitoring. These data should alleviate the concerns of some regarding the safety of the "stereotactic" method, allowing a better decision process among the different methods of invasive monitoring and ameliorating the fear associated with the placement of depth electrodes.},

abstract = {OBJECT Surgery of suspected low-grade gliomas (LGGs) poses a special challenge for neurosurgeons due to their diffusely infiltrative growth and histopathological heterogeneity. Consequently, neuronavigation with multimodality imaging data, such as structural and metabolic data, fiber tracking, and 3D brain visualization, has been proposed to optimize surgery. However, currently no standardized protocol has been established for multimodality imaging data in modern glioma surgery. The aim of this study was therefore to define a specific protocol for multimodality imaging and navigation for suspected LGG. METHODS Fifty-one patients who underwent surgery for a diffusely infiltrating glioma with nonsignificant contrast enhancement on MRI and available multimodality imaging data were included. In the first 40 patients with glioma, the authors retrospectively reviewed the imaging data, including structural MRI (contrast-enhanced T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and FLAIR sequences), metabolic images derived from PET, or MR spectroscopy chemical shift imaging, fiber tracking, and 3D brain surface/vessel visualization, to define standardized image settings and specific indications for each imaging modality. The feasibility and surgical relevance of this new protocol was subsequently prospectively investigated during surgery with the assistance of an advanced electromagnetic navigation system in the remaining 11 patients. Furthermore, specific surgical outcome parameters, including the extent of resection, histological analysis of the metabolic hotspot, presence of a new postoperative neurological deficit, and intraoperative accuracy of 3D brain visualization models, were assessed in each of these patients. RESULTS After reviewing these first 40 cases of glioma, the authors defined a specific protocol with standardized image settings and specific indications that allows for optimal and simultaneous visualization of structural and metabolic data, fiber tracking, and 3D brain visualization. This new protocol was feasible and was estimated to be surgically relevant during navigation-guided surgery in all 11 patients. According to the authors' predefined surgical outcome parameters, they observed a complete resection in all resectable gliomas (n = 5) by using contour visualization with T2-weighted or FLAIR images. Additionally, tumor tissue derived from the metabolic hotspot showed the presence of malignant tissue in all WHO Grade III or IV gliomas (n = 5). Moreover, no permanent postoperative neurological deficits occurred in any of these patients, and fiber tracking and/or intraoperative monitoring were applied during surgery in the vast majority of cases (n = 10). Furthermore, the authors found a significant intraoperative topographical correlation of 3D brain surface and vessel models with gyral anatomy and superficial vessels. Finally, real-time navigation with multimodality imaging data using the advanced electromagnetic navigation system was found to be useful for precise guidance to surgical targets, such as the tumor margin or the metabolic hotspot. CONCLUSIONS In this study, the authors defined a specific protocol for multimodality imaging data in suspected LGGs, and they propose the application of this new protocol for advanced navigation-guided procedures optimally in conjunction with continuous electromagnetic instrument tracking to optimize glioma surgery.},

Conventional approach with conservative treatment was initially adopted. The patient's condition, however, deteriorated after 2 weeks, requiring surgical evacuation of the intracranial haemorrhage. We reviewed the clinical features of this disease and the correlated magnetic resonance imaging findings with the pathophysiological mechanisms, and described treatment strategies in the local setting. Subtle findings on initial computed tomographic scan are also reported which might improve pathology recognition. Spontaneous intracranial hypotension is not uncommonly encountered in Hong Kong, and physicians must adopt a high level of clinical suspicion to facilitate early diagnosis and appropriate management. In addition, novel therapeutic approaches may be required in those with recurrent symptoms or who are refractory to current treatment strategies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND In addition to conventional magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been investigated as a potential diagnostic and prognostic tool for patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM). OBJECTIVE To assess the efficacy of cMRI and DTI parameters in prediction of surgical outcome in DCM patients. METHODS One hundred and forty-two patients with DCM who underwent presurgical cMRI and DTI of the cervical spine were included. Quantitative parameters obtained by cMRI included compression ratio (CR), transverse area (TA), and signal intensity ratio (SIR). DTI was evaluated for apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA). The Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score and recovery rate were used to evaluate clinical outcomes. A JOA recovery rate {\textless} 50{\%} was defined as a poor surgical outcome. The relationship of surgical outcome with various imaging parameters was examined. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to measure the predictive ability and determine the best cut-off values of the quantitative parameters. RESULTS By ROC curve analyses of imaging parameters, the largest area under the ROC curve (AUC) was for FA (0.750), followed by ADC (0.719), TA (0.716), SIR (0.673), and CR (0.591). The cut-off values with the best compromise between sensitivity and specificity were set at 0.390 for FA, 1.344 × 10-3 mm2/s for ADC, 46.02 mm2 for TA, 1.556 for SIR, and 26.56{\%} for CR. Multivariate logistic regression model revealed that JOA score ⩽ 8 points, TA ⩽ 46.02 mm2, and FA ⩽ 0.390 were independently associated with poor surgical outcome. The AUC value for the three-predictor model was 0.871, indicating strong predictive discrimination, and was significantly higher than the AUC value for the model containing only the JOA score (0.763; P= 0.003). CONCLUSIONS JOA score is a reasonable predictor of surgical outcome in DCM. However, a model inclusive of TA and FA provides superior predictive ability. Thus, quantitative analysis of cMRI and DTI is useful for predicting surgical outcome in DCM.},

@article{Barrey2019,
abstract = {Background: The objectives of this study were to define the role for surgery in the treatment of chronic low back pain (cLBP) and to develop a new classification of cLBP based on the pattern of injury. Hypothesis: Surgery may benefit patients with cLBP, and a new classification based on the injury pattern may be of interest. Method: A systematic literature review was performed by searching Medline, the Cochrane Library, the French public health database (Banque de Donn{\'{e}}es en Sant{\'{e}} Publique), Science Direct, and the National Guideline Clearinghouse. The main search terms were “back pain” OR “lumbar” OR “intervertebral disc replacement” OR “vertebrae” OR “spinal” AND “surgery” OR “surgical” OR “fusion” OR “laminectomy” OR “discectomy”. Results: Surgical techniques available for treating cLBP consist of fusion, disc replacement, dynamic stabilisation, and inter-spinous posterior devices. Compared to non-operative management including intensive rehabilitation therapy and cognitive behavioural therapy, fusion is not better in terms of either function (evaluated using the Oswestry Disability Index [ODI]) or pain (level 2). Fusion is better than non-operative management without intensive rehabilitation therapy (level 2). There is no evidence to date that one fusion technique is superior over the others regarding the clinical outcomes (assessed using the ODI). Compared to fusion or multidisciplinary rehabilitation therapy, disc replacement can produce better function and less pain, although the differences are not clinically significant (level 2). The available evidence does not support the use of dynamic stabilisation or interspinous posterior devices to treat cLBP due to degenerative disease (professional consensus within the French Society for Spinal Surgery). The following recommendations can be made: non-operative treatment must be provided for at least 1 year before considering surgery in patients with cLBP due to degenerative disease; patients must be fully informed about alternative treatment options and the risks associated with surgery; standing radiographs must be obtained to assess sagittal spinal alignment and a magnetic resonance imaging scan to determine the mechanism of injury; and, if fusion is performed, the lumbar lordotic curvature must be restored. Discussion: This work establishes the need for a new classification of cLBP based on the presumptive mechanism responsible for the pain. Three categories should be distinguished: non-degenerative cLBP (previously known as symptomatic cLBP), in which the cause of pain is a trauma, spondylolysis, a tumour, an infection, or an inflammatory process; degenerative cLBP (previously known as non-specific cLBP) characterised by variable combinations of degenerative alterations in one or more discs, facet joints, and/or ligaments, with or without regional and/or global alterations in spinal alignment (which must be assessed using specific parameters); and cLBP of unknown mechanism, in which the pain seems to bear no relation to the anatomical abnormalities (and the Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale may be helpful in this situation). This classification should prove useful in the future for constituting well-defined patient groups, thereby improving the assessment of treatment options. Level of evidence: II, systematic review of level II studies.},

They are mostly represented by focal seizures and spasms. Surface interictal video-EEG is characterized by background flattening and paroxysmal discharges prevalent on the affected side but not unusually extending to the controlateral hemisphere. The last occasionally shows an independent irritative activity in spite of the absence of further visible structural abnormalities. Most of the patients have visual field or visual attention deficits at diagnosis. Resective as well as disconnective surgical procedures have been proposed for the management of this condition, none of them having shown clear advantages in terms of seizure outcome and complications. Intraoperative electrocorticography (EcoG) and sensorimotor monitoring have been successfully used to improve the localization of the epileptic focus and reduce surgical complication rates. Undistincted lesion borders, independent controlateral ictal or/and interictal EEG activity, and incomplete resections/disconnections are among the main factors that have resulted to be associated with a worse seizure outcome.},

abstract = {Systematic review and survey. To perform an evidence synthesis of the literature and obtain information from the global spine care community assessing the frequency, timing, and predictors of symptom development in patients with radiographical evidence of cervical spinal cord compression, spinal canal narrowing, and/or ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) but no symptoms of myelopathy. Evidence for a marker to predict symptom development remains sparse, and there is controversy surrounding the management of asymptomatic patients. We conducted a systematic review of the English language literature and an international survey of spine surgeons to answer the following key questions in patients with radiographical evidence of cervical spinal cord compression, spinal canal narrowing, and/or OPLL but no symptoms of myelopathy: (1) What are the frequency and timing of symptom development? (2) What are the clinical, radiographical, and electrophysiological predictors of symptom development? (3) What clinical and/or radiographical features influence treatment decisions based on an international survey of spine care professionals? The initial literature search yielded 388 citations. Applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria narrowed this to 5 articles. Two of these dealt with the same population. For patients with spinal cord compression secondary to spondylosis, one study reported the frequency of myelopathy development to be 22.6{\%}. The presence of symptomatic radiculopathy, cervical cord hyperintensity on magnetic resonance imaging, and prolonged somatosensory- and motor-evoked potentials were reported in one study as significant independent predictors of myelopathy development. In contrast, the lack of magnetic resonance imaging hyperintensity was found to be a positive predictor of early myelopathy development (≤ 12-mo follow-up). For subjects with OPLL, frequency of myelopathy development was reported in 3 articles and ranged from 0.0{\%} to 61.5{\%} of subjects. One of these studies reported canal stenosis of 60{\%} or more, lateral deviated OPLL, and increased cervical range of motion as significant predictors of myelopathy development. In a survey of 774 spine surgeons, the majority deemed the presence of clinically symptomatic radiculopathy to predict progression to myelopathy in nonmyelopathic patients with cervical stenosis. Survey responses pertaining to 3 patient case vignettes are also presented and discussed in the context of the current literature. On the basis of these results, we provide a series of evidence-based recommendations related to the frequency, timing, and predictors of myelopathy development in asymptomatic patients with cervical stenosis secondary to spondylosis or OPLL. Future prospective studies are required to refine our understanding of this topic. EVIDENCE-BASED CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS: Patients with cervical canal stenosis and cord compression secondary to spondylosis, without clinical evidence of myelopathy, and who present with clinical or electrophysiological evidence of cervical radicular dysfunction or central conduction deficits seem to be at higher risk for developing myelopathy and should be counseled to consider surgical treatment. OVERALL STRENGTH OF EVIDENCE: Moderate. Strong. SUMMARY STATEMENTS: STATEMENT 1: On the basis of the current literature, for patients with cervical canal stenosis and cord compression secondary to spondylosis, without clinical evidence of myelopathy, approximately 8{\%} at 1-year follow-up and 23{\%} at a median of 44-months follow-up develop clinical evidence of myelopathy. STATEMENT 2: For patients with cervical canal stenosis and cord compression secondary to spondylosis, without clinical evidence of myelopathy, the absence of magnetic resonance imaging intramedullary T2 hyperintensity has been shown to predict early myelopathy development ({\textless}12-mo follow-up) and the presence of such signal has been shown to predict late myelopathy development (mean 44-mo follow-up). In light of this discrepancy, no definite recommendation can be made surrounding the utility of this finding in predicting myelopathy development. STATEMENT 3: For patients with OPLL but without myelopathy, no recommendation can be made regarding the incidence or predictors of progression to myelopathy.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to quantify the reproducibility, temporal stability, and functional correlation of diffusion MR characteristics in the spinal cord in patients with cervical stenosis with or without myelopathy. The association between longitudinal diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measurements and serial neurological function assessment was explored at both the group and individual level. METHODS Sixty-six nonoperatively treated patients with cervical stenosis were prospectively followed (3 months to {\textgreater} 5 years) using synchronous serial MRI and functional outcome assessment. A total of 183 separate MRI examinations were performed, separated by at least 3 months, and each patient had a minimum of 2 MRI scans (range 2-5 scans). Anatomical and DTI measurements were performed within the spinal cord at the C1-2 region as well as at the area of highest compression. Coefficients of variance (COVs) were compared across measurements in both reference tissue and areas of compression for anatomical measurements, fractional anisotropy (FA), and mean diffusivity (MD). The correlation between diffusion MR measures at the site of compression and evaluations of neurological function assessed using the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) scale at multiple time points was evaluated. RESULTS The COVs for anatomical measurements (Torg ratio and canal diameter) were between 7{\%} and 10{\%}. The median COV for FA measurements at the site of compression was 9{\%}, and for reference tissue at C1-2 it was 6{\%}. The median COV for MD at the site of compression was approximately 12{\%}, and for reference tissue at C1-2 it was 10{\%}. The FA and MD measurements of C1-2 averaged 0.61 and 0.91 $\mu$m2/msec, respectively, whereas the FA and MD measurements at the site of compression averaged 0.51 and 1.26 $\mu$m2/msec, respectively. Both FA (slope = 0.037; R2= 0.3281, p {\textless} 0.0001) and MD (slope = -0.074; R2= 0.1101, p = 0.0084) were significantly correlated with the mJOA score. The FA decreased by approximately 0.032 units per mJOA unit decrease (R2= 0.2037, p {\textless} 0.0001), whereas the MD was increased by approximately 0.084 $\mu$m2/msec for every mJOA unit decrease (R2= 0.1016, p {\textless} 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Quantitative DTI measurements of the spinal cord in patients with cervical stenosis with or without myelopathy have a median COV of 5{\%}-10{\%}, similar to anatomical measurements. The reproducibility of these measurements and significant correlation with functional outcome status suggest a potential role in the evaluation and longitudinal surveillance of nonoperatively treated patients. With respect to the specific DTI measurements, FA within the spinal cord appears slightly more sensitive to neurological function and more stable than measures of MD. Therefore, DTI of the spinal cord may be a clinically feasible imaging technique for longitudinally monitoring patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: CSM is a common neurologic disease that results in progressive disability and eventual paralysis without appropriate treatment. Imaging plays a significant role in the evaluation of CSM and has evolved with recent technical advances. We sought to systematically explore the relationship between clinical disease severity and DTI in CSM, and to investigate the potential use of DTI in surgical decision-making models.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMATERIALS AND METHODS: MR imaging studies and clinical assessments were prospectively collected on 30 patients with CSM. Spearman correlations were used to investigate associations between clinical disease severity and FA at the time of diagnosis. Clinical assessment was performed using mJOA, Nurick, Short Form-36, and NDI scores. Fifteen patients with CSM subsequently underwent decompressive surgery; Spearman correlation and logistic regression were applied to this cohort to study the relationship between baseline DTI measurements and postoperative outcome. Conventional imaging (spinal cord T2 signal intensity and degree of stenosis) was evaluated for comparison with DTI.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: At diagnosis, FA demonstrated a strong correlation with baseline mJOA (r = 0.62, P {\textless} .01) and Nurick (r = -0.46, P = .01) scores. After surgery, recovery of function demonstrated by improvement in NDI score was associated with higher FA values on preoperative DTI (r = -0.61, P = .04). Severely affected patients with CSM with disproportionately high FA tended to achieve greater mJOA scores after surgery compared with subjects with lower FA (P = .08). T2 signal intensity was associated with functional status at baseline but did not predict postoperative outcome; degree of stenosis lacked any significant correlation with clinical parameters.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: DTI may be a useful diagnostic tool for assessing disease severity in CSM. The predictive value of DTI regarding postoperative outcome may improve surgical decision-making and facilitate health care outcomes research.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Depth electrodes recordings may be required in some cases of epilepsy surgery to delineate the best region for cortical resection. We usually implant depth electrodes according to Talairach's stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) method. By using these permanently implanted depth electrodes, we are able to perform radiofrequency (RF)-thermolesions of the epileptic foci. We report the technical data required to perform such multiple cortical thermolesions, as well as preliminary results in terms of seizure outcome in a group of 20 patients. METHODS: Lesions were performed by using 100- to 110-mA bipolar current (50 V), applied for 10 to 50 s. Each thermocoagulation produced a 5- to 7-mm diameter cortical lesion. In total, two to 16 lesions were performed in each of the 20 patients. Lesions were placed without anesthesia. No general or neurologic complication occurred during the procedures. Two transient postprocedure side effects, consisting of paresthetic sensations in the mouth and mild apraxia of the hand, were observed. RESULTS: At a follow-up time of 8 to 31 months (mean, 19 months), 15{\%} of the patients became seizure free, 40{\%} experienced a {\textgreater} or =80{\%} reduction of their seizure frequency, and 45{\%} were not significantly improved. CONCLUSIONS: SEEG-guided RF thermolesions is a safe technique. Our preliminary results indicate that such lesions can lead to a significant reduction of seizure frequency and could be proposed as a palliative procedure if no resective surgery is possible. A randomized controlled trial is needed to determine which patients are likely to respond to SEEG-guided RF thermolesions.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Patients with intractable epilepsy due to extensive lesions involving the posterior quadrant (temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes) form a small subset of epilepsy surgery. This study was done with a view to analyze our experience with this group of patients and to define the changes in the surgical technique over the last 15 years. We also describe the microsurgical technique of the different surgical variants used, along with their functional neuroanatomy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: In this series there were 13 patients with a median age of 17 years. All patients had extensive presurgical evaluation that provided concordant evidence localizing the lesion and seizure focus to the posterior quadrant. The objective of the surgery was to eliminate the effect of the epileptogenic tissue and preserve motor and sensory functions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: During the course of this study period of 15 years, the surgical procedure performed evolved toward incorporating more techniques of disconnection and minimizing resection. Three technical variants were thus utilized in this series, namely, (i) anatomical posterior quadrantectomy (APQ), (ii) functional posterior quadrantectomy (FPQ), and (iii) periinsular posterior quadrantectomy (PIPQ). After a median follow-up period of 6 years, 12/13 patients had Engel's Class I seizure outcome.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The results of surgery for posterior quadrantic epilepsy have yielded excellent seizure outcomes in 92{\%} of the patients in the series with no mortality or major morbidity. The incorporation of disconnective techniques in multilobar surgery has maintained the excellent results obtained earlier with resective surgery.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of heavily T2-weighted magnetic resonance myelography (MRM) in patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH). METHODS: Patients with SIH were recruited prospectively, and first underwent MRM and then computed tomographic myelography (CTM). The results of MRM were validated with the gold standard, CTM, focusing on 1) CSF leaks along the nerve roots, 2) epidural CSF collections, and 3) high-cervical (C1-3) retrospinal CSF collections. Comparisons of these 3 findings between the 2 studies were made by kappa statistics and agreement rates. Targeted epidural blood patches (EBPs) were placed at the levels of CSF leaks if supportive treatment failed. RESULTS: Nineteen patients (6 men and 13 women, mean age 37.9 +/- 8.6 years) with SIH completed the study. MRM did not differ from CTM in the detection rates of CSF leaks along the nerve roots (84{\%} vs 74{\%}, p = 0.23), high-cervical retrospinal CSF collections (32{\%} vs 16{\%}, p = 0.13), and epidural CSF collections (89{\%} vs 79{\%}, p = 0.20). MRM demonstrated more spinal levels of CSF leaks (2.2 +/- 1.7 vs 1.5 +/- 1.5, p = 0.011) and epidural collections (12.2 +/- 5.9 vs 7.1 +/- 5.8, p {\textless} 0.001) than CTM. The overall level-by-level concordance was substantial for CSF leaks along the nerve roots (C1-L3) (kappa = 0.71, p {\textless} 0.001, agreement = 95{\%}) and high-cervical retrospinal CSF collections (C1-3) (kappa = 0.73, p {\textless} 0.001, agreement = 92{\%}), and moderate for epidural CSF collections (C1-L3) (kappa = 0.47, p {\textless} 0.001, agreement = 72{\%}). Ten of the 14 patients (71{\%}) receiving targeted EBPs experienced sustained symptomatic relief after a single attempt. CONCLUSIONS: Heavily T2-weighted magnetic resonance myelography was accurate in localizing CSF leaks for patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension. This noninvasive technique may be an alternative to computed tomographic myelography before targeted epidural blood patches.},

abstract = {Study Design—Randomized trial with a concurrent observational cohort study Objective—To compare 8-year outcomes of surgery to non-operative care for symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis (SpS) Summary of Background Data—Surgery for SpS has been shown to be more effective compared to non-operative treatment over four years, but longer-term data is less clear. Methods—Surgical candidates from 13 centers in 11 U.S. states with at least 12 weeks of symptoms and confirmatory imaging were enrolled in a randomized cohort (RCT) or observational cohort (OBS). Treatment was standard decompressive laminectomy versus standard non-operative care. Primary outcomes were SF-36 bodily pain (BP) and physical function (PF) scales and the modified Oswestry Disability index (ODI) assessed at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and yearly up to 8 years. Results—55{\%} of RCT and 52{\%} of OBS participants provided data at the 8-year follow-up. Intent-to-treat analyses showed no differences between randomized cohorts; however, 70{\%} of those randomized to surgery and 52{\%} of those randomized to non-operative had undergone surgery by 8 years. As-treated analyses in the RCT showed the early benefit for surgery out to 4 years converged over time with no significant treatment effect of surgery seen in years 6–8 for any of the primary outcomes. In contrast, the OBS group showed a stable advantage for surgery in all outcomes between years 5–8. Patients who were lost to follow-up were older, less well-educated, sicker, and had worse outcomes over the first 2 years in both surgery and non-operative arms. Conclusions—Patients with symptomatic spinal stenosis show diminishing benefits of surgery in as-treated analyses of the RCT between 4–8 years while outcomes in the OBS group remained stable. Loss to follow-up of patients with worse early outcomes in both treatment groups could lead to overestimates of long-term outcomes, but likely not bias treatment effect estimates.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Intracranial hemangiopericytoma (HPC) is a malignant meningothelial tumor. Because of its rarity, few guidelines exist for optimal management.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: University of California at San Francisco patients managed for intracranial HPC were compiled into a single database based on a retrospective review of patient records. Univariate and multivariate regression was performed to determine factors that independently predicted treatment outcomes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A total of 40 patients with intracranial HPC were treated from 1989 to 2010. Treatment and follow-up information was available for analysis on 35 patients. The median survival for all patients was 16.2 years after date of diagnosis, with 1-year, 5-year, and 10-year survival rates of 100{\%}, 92{\%}, and 68{\%}, respectively. Nineteen patients (54{\%}) had HPC recurrence. The median time until recurrence was 5 years, with 1-year, 5-year, and 10-year progression-free survival rates of 96{\%}, 49{\%}, and 28{\%}, respectively. Seven patients (20{\%}) developed extracranial metastasis. Tumor characteristics associated with earlier recurrence included size ≥6 cm (log-rank, P {\textless} .05) and nonskull base location (log-rank, P {\textless} .05). Strategies combining adjuvant radiation with tumor resection appeared to hinder tumor progression, but had no effect on overall survival or the development of metastasis. Greater extent of resection was associated with increased overall survival (log-rank, P {\textless} .05).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant radiation may show promise in preventing tumor progression, but recurrence remains a common treatment outcome regardless of initial strategy. When safe and feasible, gross total resection should be pursued as an initial surgical strategy to maximize overall survival. The propensity of these tumors to metastasize makes detailed staging imaging necessary.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Spontaneous intracranial hypotension has become a well-recognized cause of headaches and a wide variety of other manifestations have been reported. Recently, several patients with asymptomatic spontaneous intracranial hypotension were reported. I now report two patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension who developed multiple arterial strokes associated with death in one patient, illustrating the spectrum of disease severity in spontaneous intracranial hypotension.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Medical records and radiologic imaging of the two patients were reviewed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Case 1. A 45-year-old man presented with an orthostatic headache. Neurologic examination was normal. MRI showed bilateral subdural fluid collections, brain sagging, and pachymeningeal enhancement. At lumbar puncture, the opening pressure was too low to record. He underwent two epidural blood patches with transient improvement of symptoms. His headaches progressed and a CT-myelogram showed a lower cervical CSF leak. Subsequently, periodic lethargy and confusion was noted and he then rapidly deteriorated. Examination showed coma (GCS: 4 [E1, M2, V1]), a fixed and dilated right pupil, and decerebrate posturing. Bilateral craniotomies were performed for the evacuation of chronic subdural hematomas. Immediate postoperative CT showed bilateral posterior cerebral artery infarcts and a recurrent right subdural hematoma, requiring re-evacuation. Postoperative examination was consistent with brain death and support was withdrawn.  Case 2. A 42-year-old man presented with a non-positional headache. Neurologic examination was normal. CT showed bilateral acute on chronic subdural hematomas and effacement of the basilar cisterns. MRI showed brain sagging, bilateral subdural hematomas, and pachymeningeal enhancement. Bilateral craniotomies were performed and subdural hematomas were evacuated. Postoperatively, the patient became progressively lethargic (GCS: 8 [E2, M4, V2]) and variable degrees of pupillary asymmetry and quadriparesis were noted. MRI now also showed multiple areas of restricted diffusion in the pons and midbrain, consistent with multiple infarcts. CT showed worsening subdural fluid collections with midline shift and increased effacement of the basilar cisterns. Repeat bilateral craniotomies were performed for evacuation of the subdural fluid collections. Neurologic examination was then noted to be fluctuating but clearly improved when lying flat (GCS: 10T [E4, M6, VT]). CT-myelography demonstrated an extensive cervico-thoracic CSF leak. An epidural blood patch was performed. The patient made a good, but incomplete, recovery with residual quadriparesis and dysphagia.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Arterial cerebral infarcts are rare, but potentially life-threatening complications of spontaneous intracranial hypotension. The strokes are due to downward displacement of the brain and can be precipitated by craniotomy for evacuation of associated subdural hematomas.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Surgery for spinal stenosis is widely performed, but its effectiveness as compared with nonsurgical treatment has not been shown in controlled trials. METHODS: Surgical candidates with a history of at least 12 weeks of symptoms and spinal stenosis without spondylolisthesis (as confirmed on imaging) were enrolled in either a randomized cohort or an observational cohort at 13 U.S. spine clinics. Treatment was decompressive surgery or usual nonsurgical care. The primary outcomes were measures of bodily pain and physical function on the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-36) and the modified Oswestry Disability Index at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 and 2 years. RESULTS: A total of 289 patients were enrolled in the randomized cohort, and 365 patients were enrolled in the observational cohort. At 2 years, 67{\%} of patients who were randomly assigned to surgery had undergone surgery, whereas 43{\%} of those who were randomly assigned to receive nonsurgical care had also undergone surgery. Despite the high level of nonadherence, the intention-to-treat analysis of the randomized cohort showed a significant treatment effect favoring surgery on the SF-36 scale for bodily pain, with a mean difference in change from baseline of 7.8 (95{\%} confidence interval, 1.5 to 14.1); however, there was no significant difference in scores on physical function or on the Oswestry Disability Index. The as-treated analysis, which combined both cohorts and was adjusted for potential confounders, showed a significant advantage for surgery by 3 months for all primary outcomes; these changes remained significant at 2 years. CONCLUSIONS: In the combined as-treated analysis, patients who underwent surgery showed significantly more improvement in all primary outcomes than did patients who were treated nonsurgically.

abstract = {Background Spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage accounts for 20{\%} of all stroke-related sudden neurological deficits, has the highest morbidity and mortality of all stroke, and the role of surgery remains controversial. We undertook a prospective randomised trial to compare early surgery with initial conservative treatment for patients with intracerebral haemorrhage. Methods A parallel-group trial design was used. Early surgery combined haematoma evacuation (within 24 h of randomisation) with medical treatment. Initial conservative treatment used medical treatment, although later evacuation was allowed if necessary. We used the eight-point Glasgow outcome scale obtained by postal questionnaires sent directly to patients at 6 months follow-up as the primary outcome measure. We divided the patients into good and poor prognosis groups on the basis of their clinical status at randomisation. For the good prognosis group, a favourable outcome was defined as good recovery or moderate disability on the Glasgow outcome scale. For the poor prognosis group, a favourable outcome also included the upper level of severe disability. Analysis was by intention to treat. Findings 1033 patients from 83 centres in 27 countries were randomised to early surgery (503) or initial conservative treatment (530). At 6 months, 51 patients were lost to follow-up, and 17 were alive with unknown status. Of 468 patients randomised to early surgery, 122 (26{\%}) had a favourable outcome compared with 118 (24{\%}) of 496 randomised to initial conservative treatment (odds ratio 0{\textperiodcentered}89 [95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}66-1{\textperiodcentered}19], p=0{\textperiodcentered}414); absolute benefit 2{\textperiodcentered}3{\%} (-3{\textperiodcentered}2 to 7{\textperiodcentered}7), relative benefit 10{\%} (-13 to 33). Interpretation Patients with spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage in neurosurgical units show no overall benefit from early surgery when compared with initial conservative treatment.},

abstract = {Anatomical hemispherectomy has been used for the treatment of seizures since 1938. However, it was almost abandoned in the 1960s after reports of postoperative fatalities caused by hydrocephalus, hemosiderosis, and trivial head traumas. Despite serious complications, the remarkable improvement of patients encouraged authors to carry out modifications on anatomical hemispherectomy in order to lessen its morbidity while preserving its efficacy. The effort to improve the technique generated several original procedures. This paper reviews current techniques of hemispherectomy and proposes a classification scheme based on their surgical characteristics. Techniques of hemispherectomy were sorted into two major groups: (1) those that remove completely the cortex from the hemisphere and (2) those that associate partial cortical removal and disconnection. Group 1 was subdivided into two subgroups based on the integrity of the ventricular cavity and group 2 was subdivided into three subgroups depending on the amount and location of the corticectomy. Grouping similar techniques may allow a better understanding of the distinctive features of each one and creates the possibility of comparing data from different authors.},

abstract = {Studies revealed that navigation systems that provided intraoperative assistance might improve pedicle screw insertion accuracy, and also implied that different systems provided different pedicle screw insertion accuracy. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to focus on the pedicle screw insertion accuracy with or without the assistance of image-guided system, and the variance among the different navigation systems. Comparative studies were searched on pedicle screw insertion accuracy between conventional and navigated method, and among different navigation systems. A total of 43 papers, including 28 clinical, 14 cadaveric and 1 model studies, were included in the current study. For clinical articles, there were 3 randomized clinical trials, 4 prospective comparative studies and 21 retrospective comparative studies. The incidence of pedicle violation among computer tomography-based navigation method group was statistically significantly less than that observed among the conventional group (OR 95{\%} CI, in vivo: 0.32-0.60; in vitro: 0.24-0.75 P {\textless} 0.01). Two-dimensional fluoroscopy-based navigation system (OR 95{\%} CI, in vivo: 0.27-0.48; in vitro: 0.43-0.88 P {\textless} 0.01) and three-dimension fluoroscopy-based navigation system (OR 95{\%} CI, in vivo: 0.09-0.38; in vitro: 0.09-0.36 P {\textless} 0.01) also obtained significant reduced screw deviation rate over traditional methods. Between navigated approaches, statistically insignificant individual and pooled RR values were observed for all in vivo subgroups. Pooled estimate of in vitro studies show that computer tomography-based and three-dimension fluoroscopy-based navigation system provided more accurate pedicle screw insertion over two-dimension fluoroscopy-based navigation system. Our review showed that navigation provided a higher accuracy in the placement of pedicle screws compared with conventional methods. The superiority of navigation systems was obvious when they were applied to abnormal spinal structure. Although no strong in vivo evidence has detected significantly different pedicle screw placement accuracy among the three major navigation systems, meta-analysis revealed the variance in pedicle screw insertion accuracy with different navigation methods.},

abstract = {Intracranial hypotension is a disorder of CSF hypovolemia due to iatrogenic or spontaneous spinal CSF leakage. Rarely, positional headaches may progress to coma, with frequent misdiagnosis. The authors review reported cases of verified intracranial hypotension-associated coma, including 3 previously unpublished cases, totaling 29. Most patients presented with headache prior to neurological deterioration, with positional symptoms elicited in almost half. Eight patients had recently undergone a spinal procedure such as lumbar drainage. Diagnostic workup almost always began with a head CT scan. Subdural collections were present in 86{\%}; however, intracranial hypotension was frequently unrecognized as the underlying cause. Twelve patients underwent one or more procedures to evacuate the collections, sometimes with transiently improved mental status. However, no patient experienced lasting neurological improvement after subdural fluid evacuation alone, and some deteriorated further. Intracranial hypotension was diagnosed in most patients via MRI studies, which were often obtained due to failure to improve after subdural hematoma (SDH) evacuation. Once the diagnosis of intracranial hypotension was made, placement of epidural blood patches was curative in 85{\%} of patients. Twenty-seven patients (93{\%}) experienced favorable outcomes after diagnosis and treatment; 1 patient died, and 1 patient had a morbid outcome secondary to duret hemorrhages. The literature review revealed that numerous additional patients with clinical histories consistent with intracranial hypotension but no radiological confirmation developed SDH following a spinal procedure. Several such patients experienced poor outcomes, and there were multiple deaths. To facilitate recognition of this treatable but potentially life-threatening condition, the authors propose criteria that should prompt intracranial hypotension workup in the comatose patient and present a stepwise management algorithm to guide the appropriate diagnosis and treatment of these patients.},

Evidence on the operative management of degenerative spondylolisthesis is still divisive.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Relevant RCT and comparative observational studies between 1966 and June 2005 were identified. Abstracted outcomes included clinical outcome, reoperation rate, and solid fusion status. Analyses were separated into: 1) fusion versus decompression alone and 2) instrumented fusion versus noninstrumented fusion.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Thirteen studies were included. The studies were generally of low methodologic quality. A satisfactory clinical outcome was significantly more likely with fusion than with decompression alone (relative risk, 1.40; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.04-1.89; P {\textless} 0.05). The use of adjunctive instrumentation significantly increased the probability of attaining solid fusion (relative risk, 1.37; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.07-1.75; P {\textless} 0.05), but no significant improvement in clinical outcome was recorded (relative risk, 1.19; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.92-1.54). There was a nonsignificant trend toward lower repeat operations with fusion compared with both decompression alone and instrumented fusion.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Spinal fusion may lead to a better clinical outcome than decompression alone. No conclusion about the clinical benefit of instrumenting a spinal fusion could be made. However, there is moderate evidence that the use of instrumentation improves the chance of achieving solid fusion.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency thermocoagulation (RFTC) guided by stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) has proved to be a safe palliative method to reduce seizure frequency in patients with drug-resistant partial epilepsy. In malformation of cortical development (MCD), increasing the number of implanted electrodes over that needed for mapping of the epileptogenic zone could help to maximize RFTC efficiency. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the benefit of SEEG-guided RFTC in 14 patients suffering from drug-resistant epilepsy related to MCD located in functional cortical areas or in regions poorly accessible to surgery. METHODS: Ten men and 4 women were treated by RFTC. Thermolesions were produced by applying a 50-V, 120-mA current for 10 to 30 seconds within the epileptogenic zone as identified by the SEEG investigation. RESULTS: An average of 25.8 6 17.5 thermolesions were made per procedure. The median follow-up after the procedure was 41.7 months. Sixty-four percent of the patients experienced a long-term decrease in seizure frequency of.50{\%}, of whom6 (43{\%}) presented long-lasting freedom from seizure. When a focal low-voltage fast activity was present at seizure onset on SEEG recordings, 87.5{\%} of patients were responders or seizure free. All of the patients in whom electric stimulation reproduced spontaneous seizures were responders. CONCLUSION: Our results show the good benefit-risk ratio of the SEEG-guided procedure for patients suffering from MCD in whom surgery is risky. This study identifies 2 factors, focal low-voltage, high-frequency activity at seizure onset and lowered epileptogenic threshold in the coagulated area, that could be predictive of a favorable seizure outcome after RFTC.},

abstract = {Although almost all pituitary tumors are benign adenomas, a surprisingly large number of these tumors invade tissues outside of the pituitary gland. Such invasion, by itself, is not diagnostic of pituitary carcinomas, which are exceedingly rare (0.13{\%} of 2,342 pituitary tumors in one series). Several different criteria are available to determine whether a tumor is invasive. Intraoperative biopsies demonstrate an 85{\%} incidence of microscopic invasion of the dura. Evidence of gross invasion at surgery and radiologic evidence of invasion on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomographic (CT) scans occur at a much lower incidence but may be more predictive of surgical cure. Invasive adenomas also have higher proliferation rates than do noninvasive adenomas, as shown by immunohistochemical detection of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), Ki-67, and MIB-1. The expression of p53, increased epidermal growth factor receptors, and protein kinase C activity also correlate with invasion and aggressive behavior. Clinically significant invasion is more frequent with macroadenomas. Macroadenomas of all pituitary tumor subtypes except gonadotroph macroadenomas have a greater than 50{\%} incidence of gross invasion. Currently, there is no accepted means of predicting an adenoma's clinically significant invasiveness and long-term aggressiveness.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The assessment of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) traditionally focuses on the hippocampal formation. These patients, however, may present structural abnormalities in other brain areas. Our purpose was to develop a method to measure the combined volume of the human piriform cortex and cortical amygdala (PCA) by using MR imaging and to investigate PCA atrophy. METHODS: The definition of anatomic landmarks on MR images was based on histologic analysis of 23 autopsy control subjects. Thirty-nine adults with chronic TLE and 23 age-matched control subjects were studied. All underwent high-spatial-resolution MR imaging at 1.5T, including a tilted T1-weighted 3D dataset. The PCA volumes were compared with the control values and further correlated with hippocampal, amygdala, and entorhinal cortex volumes. RESULTS: The normal volume was 530 +/- 59 mm(3) (422-644) [mean +/- 1 SD (range)] on the right and 512 +/- 60 mm(3) (406-610) on the left PCA (no asymmetry, and no age or sex effect). The intraobserver and interobserver variability were 6{\%} and 8{\%}, respectively. In right TLE patients, the mean right PCA volume was 18{\%} smaller than in control subjects (P {\textless} .001) and 15{\%} smaller than in left TLE (P {\textless} .001). In left TLE, the mean left PCA volume was 16{\%} smaller than in control subjects (P {\textless} .001) and 19{\%} smaller than in right TLE (P {\textless} .001). Overall, 46{\%} (18/39) of the patients had a greater than 20{\%} volume reduction in the ipsilateral PCA. There was bilateral atrophy in 18{\%} (7/39). Patients with hippocampal volumes of at least 2 SDs below the control mean had an 18{\%} reduction in the mean PCA volume compared with patients without hippocampal atrophy (P {\textless} .001). Ipsilaterally, hippocampal (r = 0.756, P {\textless} .01), amygdaloid (r = 0.548, P {\textless} .01), and entorhinal (r = 0.500, P {\textless} .01) volumes correlated with the PCA volumes. CONCLUSION: The quantification of PCA volume with MR imaging showed that the PCA is extensively damaged in chronic TLE patients, particularly in those with hippocampal atrophy.},

This study identifies 2 factors, focal low-voltage, high-frequency activity at seizure onset and lowered epileptogenic threshold in the coagulated area, that could be predictive of a favorable seizure outcome after RFTC.},

abstract = {OBJECT Cerebral gangliogliomas (GGs) are highly associated with intractable epilepsy. Incomplete resection due to proximity to eloquent brain regions or misinterpretation of the resection amount is a strong negative predictor for local tumor recurrence and persisting seizures. A potential method for dealing with this obstacle could be the application of intraoperative high-field MRI (iopMRI) combined with neuronavigation. METHODS Sixty-nine patients (31 female, 38 male; median age 28.5 ± 15.4 years) suffering from cerebral GGs were included in this retrospective study. Five patients received surgery twice in the observation period. In 48 of the 69 patients, 1.5-T iopMRI combined with neuronavigational guidance was used. Lesions close to eloquent brain areas were resected with the implementation of preoperative diffusion tensor imaging tractography and blood oxygenation level-dependent functional MRI (15 patients). RESULTS Overall, complete resection was accomplished in 60 of 69 surgical procedures (87{\%}). Two patients underwent biopsy only, and in 7 patients, subtotal resection was accomplished because of proximity to critical brain areas. Excluding the 2 biopsies, complete resection using neuronavigation/iopMRI was documented in 33 of 46 cases (72{\%}) by intraoperative imaging. Remnant tumor mass was identified intraoperatively in 13 of 46 patients (28{\%}). After intraoperative second-look surgery, the authors improved the total resection rate by 9 patients (up to 91{\%} [42 of 46]). Of 21 patients undergoing conventional surgery, 14 (67{\%}) had complete resection without the use of iopMRI. Regarding epilepsy outcome, 42 of 60 patients with seizures (70{\%}) became completely seizure free (Engel Class IA) after a median follow-up time of 55.5 ± 36.2 months. Neurological deficits were found temporarily in 1 (1.4{\%}) patient and permanently in 4 (5.8{\%}) patients. CONCLUSIONS Using iopMRI combined with neuronavigation in cerebral GG surgery, the authors raised the rate of complete resection in this series by 19{\%}. Given the fact that total resection is a strong predictor of long-term seizure control, this technique may contribute to improved seizure outcome and reduced neurological morbidity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reproducibility is the hallmark of good science. Maintaining a high degree of transparency in scientific reporting is essential not just for gaining trust and credibility within the scientific community but also for facilitating the development of new ideas. Sharing data and computer code associated with publications is becoming increasingly common, motivated partly in response to data deposition requirements from journals and mandates from funders. Despite this increase in transparency, it is still difficult to reproduce or build upon the findings of most scientific publications without access to a more complete workflow.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nFINDINGS: Version control systems (VCS), which have long been used to maintain code repositories in the software industry, are now finding new applications in science. One such open source VCS, Git, provides a lightweight yet robust framework that is ideal for managing the full suite of research outputs such as datasets, statistical code, figures, lab notes, and manuscripts. For individual researchers, Git provides a powerful way to track and compare versions, retrace errors, explore new approaches in a structured manner, while maintaining a full audit trail. For larger collaborative efforts, Git and Git hosting services make it possible for everyone to work asynchronously and merge their contributions at any time, all the while maintaining a complete authorship trail. In this paper I provide an overview of Git along with use-cases that highlight how this tool can be leveraged to make science more reproducible and transparent, foster new collaborations, and support novel uses.},

abstract = {OBJECT: Spontaneous intracranial hypotension is a noteworthy but commonly misdiagnosed cause of new daily persistent headaches. Subdural fluid collections are frequent radiographic findings, but they can be interpreted as primary rather than secondary pathological entities, and uncertainties exist regarding their optimal management. The authors therefore reviewed their experience with subdural fluid collections in 40 consecutive patients with spontaneous spinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks and intracranial hypotension. METHODS: The mean age of the 26 female and 14 male patients was 43 years (range 13-72 years). Subdural fluid collections were present in 20 patients (50{\%}); 12 of these patients (60{\%}) had subdural hygromas alone, and eight (40{\%}) had subacute to chronic subdural hematomas (SDHs) associated with significant mass effect. The subdural hygromas resolved within several days to weeks following treatment of the underlying CSF leak. Three patients with SDHs underwent evacuation of the hematoma prior to the establishment of the diagnosis of spontaneous intracranial hypotension, but the SDHs did not resolve until the underlying spinal CSF leak was treated. In the remaining five patients, the CSF leak was treated primarily and the SDHs resolved over a 1- to 3-month period without the need for evacuation. CONCLUSIONS: Subdural fluid collections are common in spontaneous intracranial hypotension, varying in appearance from thin subdural hygromas to large SDHs associated with significant mass effect. These collections can be safely managed by directing treatment at the underlying CSF leak without the need for hematoma evacuation.},

abstract = {Degenerative spondylolisthesis is a common presentation, yet the best surgical treatment continues to be a matter of debate. Interbody fusion is one of a number of options, but its exact role remains ill defined. The aim of this study was to provide a contemporary review of the literature to help determine the role, if any, of interbody fusion in the surgical treatment of degenerative spondylolisthesis. A systematic review of the literature since 2005 was performed. Details on study size, patient age, surgical treatments, levels of slip, patient reported outcome measures, radiographic outcomes, complications and selected utility measures were recorded. Studies that compared a cohort treated with interbody fusion and at least one other surgical intervention for comparison were included for review. Only studies examining the effect in degenerative spondylolisthesis were included. Two authors independently reviewed the manuscripts and extracted key data. Thirteen studies were included in the final analysis. A total of 565 underwent interbody fusion and 761 underwent other procedures including decompression alone, interspinous stabilisation and posterolateral fusion with or without instrumentation. Most studies were graded Level III evidence. Heterogeneous reporting of outcomes prevented formal statistical analysis. However, in general, studies reviewed concluded no significant clinical or radiographic difference in outcome between interbody fusion and other treatments. Two small studies suggested interbody fusion is a better option in cases of definite instability. Interbody fusion only provided outcomes as good as instrumented posterolateral fusion. However, most studies were Level III, and hence, we remain limited in defining the exact role of interbody fusion---cases with clear instability appear to be most appropriate. Future work should use agreed-upon common outcome measures and definitions.},

Technical advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and surgical procedures (ultrasonic cavitation aspirators [CUSA], lasers) have brought about better clinical results. In spite of these new techniques, a small percentage of patients still present with poor postoperative results and/or a recurrence. The authors tried to determine which data could influence clinical outcome and what therapeutic modalities could limit recurrence rate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed 54 patients who from 1963 to 1994, each had surgery for an intraspinal meningioma. There were 43 females and 11 males, aged 8 to 85 years old. Thirty-six (66.6{\%}) patients were ambulatory on admission; only 2 presented with a paraplegia. Tumor location was cervical in 10 cases, thoracic in 43 cases, lumbar in 1 case. Forty-seven tumors were intradural, 5 epidural, 2 epidural and intradural. Thirty patients underwent a myelography, 10 a computed tomography (CT) scan, and 14 an MRI. Twenty-three spinal angiographies were performed before surgery. Complete removal was achieved in 50 patients (92.6{\%}). Ultrasonic cavitation was used 10 times for debulking the tumor, and laser was used in 12 surgical procedures to perform hemostasis of the meningioma and to coagulate the dural attachment. RESULTS: The majority of the neoplasms were meningothelial (N = 24) or psammomatous (N = 11). No mortality was noted. Morbidity concerned five patients: two pulmonary embolisms, one definitive paraplegia, one transient deficit, and one epidural suppuration, which necessitated a second operation. Mean follow-up was 28 months. Final functional results were very good in 85{\%} and good in 13{\%}; one patient (2{\%}) worsened. Two recurrences were noted: one with clinical signs and the other with only CT-scan modifications. Both patients underwent complementary radiotherapy. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The authors discuss factors influencing functional results. Sex, pregnancy, pathologic diagnosis, and recurrence do not seem to have any influence. Calcification of the meningioma, as well as an anterior dural attachment, are pejorative factors. They insist on preoperative angiography and point out the advantage of using a CUSA and/or a laser to debulk and coagulate the tumor itself and its dural attachment. They propose radiation therapy as an adjuvant treatment or an alternative to reoperation, which could be hazardous for some patients when, for instance, a recurrence is located in a critical area or when the patient's general status is fragile.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: We aimed to determine cut-offs between mild, moderate and severe myelopathy on the modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) score. METHODS: Between December 2005 and January 2011, 757 patients with clinically diagnosed DCM were enrolled in the prospective AOSpine North America (n = 278) or International (n = 479) study at 26 sites. Functional status and quality of life were evaluated at baseline using a variety of outcome measures. Using the Nurick score as an anchor, receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis was conducted to determine cut-offs between mild, moderate and severe disease. The validity of the identified cut-offs was evaluated by examining whether patients in different severity groups differed in terms of impairment, disability, quality of life and number of signs and symptoms. RESULTS: A mJOA of 14 was determined to be the cut-off between mild and moderate myelopathy and a mJOA of 11 was the cut-off score between moderate and severe disease. Patients in the severe myelopathy group (n = 254) had significantly reduced quality of life and functional status and a greater number of signs and symptoms compared to patients classified as mild (n = 190) or moderate (n = 296). CONCLUSIONS: Mild myelopathy can be defined as mJOA from 15 to 17, moderate as mJOA from 12 to 14 and severe as mJOA from 0 to 11. These categories should be adopted worldwide to standardize clinical assessment of DCM.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Kato et al. Objectives The Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score is widely used to assess the severity of clinical symptoms in patients with cervical compressive myelopathy, particularly in East Asian countries. In contrast, modified versions of the JOA score are currently accepted as the standard tool for assessment in Western countries. The objective of the present study is to compare these scales and clarify their differences and interchangeability and verify their validity by comparing them to other outcome measures. Materials and Methods Five institutions participated in this prospective multicenter observational study. The JOA and modified JOA (mJOA) proposed by Benzel were recorded preoperatively and at three months postoperatively in patients with cervical compressive myelopathy who underwent decompression surgery. Patient reported outcome (PRO) measures, including Japanese Orthopaedic Association Cervical Myelopathy Evaluation Questionnaire (JOACMEQ), the Short Form-12 (SF-12) and the Neck Disability Index (NDI), were also recorded. The preoperative JOA score and mJOA score were compared to each other and the PRO values. A Bland-Altman analysis was performed to investigate their limits of agreement. Results A total of ninety-two patients were included. The correlation coefficient (Spearman's rho) between the JOA and mJOA was 0.87. In contrast, the correlations between JOA/mJOA and the other PRO values were moderate (|rho| = 0.03 - 0.51). The correlation coefficient of the recovery rate between the JOA and mJOA was 0.75. The Bland-Altman analyses showed that limits of agreement were 3.6 to -1.2 for the total score, and 55.1{\%}to -68.8{\%} for the recovery rates. Conclusions In the present study, the JOA score and the mJOA score showed good correlation with each other in terms of their total scores and recovery rates. Previous studies using the JOA can be interpreted based on the mJOA; however it is not ideal to use them interchangeably. The validity of both scores was demonstrated by comparing these values to the PRO values.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVEEnhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) has led to a paradigm shift in various surgical specialties. Its application can result in substantial benefits in perioperative healthcare utilization through preoperative physical and mental patient optimization and modulation of the recovery process. Still, ERAS remains relatively new to spine surgery. The authors report their 5-year experience, focusing on ERAS application to a broad population of patients with degenerative spine conditions undergoing elective surgical procedures, including anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF).METHODSA multimodal ERAS protocol was applied between November 2013 and October 2018. The authors analyze hospital stay, perioperative outcomes, readmissions, and adverse events obtained from a prospective institutional registry. Elective tubular microdiscectomy and mini-open decompression as well as minimally invasive (MI) anterior or posterior fusion cases were included. Their institutional ERAS protocol contains 22 pre-, intra-, and postoperative elements, including preoperative patient counseling, MI techniques, early mobilization and oral intake, minimal postoperative restrictions, and regular audits.RESULTSA total of 2592 consecutive patients were included, with 199 (8{\%}) undergoing fusion. The mean hospital stay was 1.1 ± 1.2 days, with 20 (0.8{\%}) 30-day and 36 (1.4{\%}) 60-day readmissions. Ninety-four percent of patients were discharged after a maximum 1-night hospital stay. Over the 5-year period, a clear trend toward a higher proportion of patients discharged home after a 1-night stay was observed (p {\textless} 0.001), with a concomitant decrease in adverse events in the overall cohort (p = 0.025) and without increase in readmissions. For fusion procedures, the rate of 1-night hospital stays increased from 26{\%} to 85{\%} (p {\textless} 0.001). Similarly, the average length of hospital stay decreased steadily from 2.4 ± 1.2 days to 1.5 ± 0.3 days (p {\textless} 0.001), with a notable concomitant decrease in variance, resulting in an estimated reduction in nursing costs of 46.8{\%}.CONCLUSIONSApplication of an ERAS protocol over 5 years to a diverse population of patients undergoing surgical procedures, including ALIF, for treatment of degenerative spine conditions was safe and effective, without increase in readmissions. The data from this large case series stress the importance of the multidisciplinary, iterative improvement process to overcome the learning curve associated with ERAS implementation, and the importance of a dedicated perioperative care team. Prospective trials are needed to evaluate spinal ERAS on a higher level of evidence.},

abstract = {Background: Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) is used for locating and outlining cortical representation areas, e.g., of motor function and speech. At present there are no standard methods of measuring the size of the cortical representation areas mapped with nTMS. The aim was to compare four computation methods for estimating muscle representation size and location for nTMS studies. New method: The motor cortex of six subjects was mapped to outline the motor cortical representation of hand muscles. Four methods were compared to assess cortical representation size in nTMS. These methods included: (1) spline interpolation method, (2) convex hull method, which outlines all positive motor responses, (3) Voronoi tessellation method, which assigns a specific cortical area for each stimulus location, and (4) average point-area method, which computes an average representation area for each stimulus with the assumption of evenly spaced stimulus locations, i.e., the use of a grid. Results: All applied methods demonstrated good repeatability in measuring muscle representation size and location, while the spline interpolation and the convex hull method demonstrated systematically larger representation areas (p{\textless} 0.05) as compared to the average point-area method. Spline interpolation method demonstrated the best repeatability in location. Comparison with existing methods: Unlike the previous methods, the presented methods can be applied for the estimation of the representation area of nTMS-induced activation without the use of an evenly spaced stimulus grid. Conclusions: The spline interpolation method and the Voronoi tessellation method could be used for evaluating motor cortical muscle representation size and location with nTMS, e.g., to study cortical plasticity. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

These anatomic considerations are divided into sections dealing with the relationships at the lateral end of the tumor in the meatus and those on the medial end of the tumor at the brain stem. The anatomy of the region offers the opportunity for three approaches to the tumor in the meatus and cerebellopontine angle. One is directed through the middle cranial fossa and the roof of the meatus. Another is directed throught the labyrinth and posterior surface of the temporal bone. The third is directed through the posterior cranial fossa and posterior meatel lip. The anatomy presented by all three approaches is reviewed in this article. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess long-term outcome and identify prognostic factors of radiofrequency thermocoagulation (RFTC) following stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) explorations in particularly complex cases of focal epilepsy. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical charts, video-SEEG recordings, and outcomes for 23 patients (aged 6-53 years) treated with SEEG-guided RFTC, of whom 15 had negative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, and 10 were considered noneligible for resective surgery after SEEG. Two to 11 RFTCs per patient (mean 5) were produced by applying 40-50 V, 75-110 mA current for 10-60 s on SEEG electrode contacts within the epileptogenic region, which was very close to eloquent cortices in 12 cases. The general features, SEEG findings, and RFTC extent of the patients were analyzed to extract potential preoperative predictors of post-RFTC seizure outcomes. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 32 months (range 2-119 months), eight patients experienced a ≥50{\%} decrease of seizure frequency after RFTC (R+, 34.8{\%}), of whom one had a sustained seizure freedom and 15 patients did not benefit from RFTC (R-, 65.2{\%}). The presence of an MRI lesion was the only significant predictor of a positive outcome, whereas location of epilepsy, extent of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) and of the seizure onset zone, induction of seizures by electrical stimulation, as well as the ratio of the coagulated sites did not show a significant correlation to the RFTC response. However, (sub-)continuous IEDs were more frequently found in R+ than in R- patients, thus suggesting that this EEG marker of the epileptogenic tissue might predict a positive outcome even in patients without obvious MRI lesion. SIGNIFICANCE: Our study confirms that RFTC, although less effective than resective surgery, can be a reasonable therapeutic option in complex cases where anatomic constraints make impossible any cortical resection. Further prospective studies are needed to better define RFTC indications and to optimize its methodology.},

abstract = {AIM: To assess the surgical outcomes of temporo-parieto-occipital (TPO) and parieto-occipital (PO) disconnection surgery for children with intractable posterior quadrantic epilepsy and a unilateral posterior quadrant lesion based on MRI and functional imaging abnormality in the TPO region on one side. METHODS: A retrospective review of data of 12 children who underwent TPO or PO disconnective surgery was carried out from September 2009 to September 2012. Three-dimensional surface reconstructions of MRI scans and intraoperative electrophysiological monitoring were used during surgery. Drugs were not discontinued after surgery in any patient. RESULTS: The affected hemisphere was the left in seven patients and the right in five patients. The mean ages at seizure onset and at surgery were four years and 12.3 years, respectively. At the time of surgery, 3 children had atonic seizures, 4 had symptomatic epilepsy with focal seizures and alteration of conscioussness, 4 had secondarily generalised seizures, and 1 child had spasms and tonic seizures. All patients had developmental delay. A pure TPO disconnection was performed in 11 patients and a PO disconnection was performed in the remaining patient. On pathological examination, 3 patients were shown to have focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) Ib, 2 with FCD IIa, 5 with FCD IIb, 1 with gliosis, and 1 with gliosis plus FCD IIa. Following surgery, 2 patients had oedema; 1 required another operation to resect the occipital lobe. At a mean follow-up of 34.5 months, 9 patients (75{\%}) were classified as Engel class I, 2 as Engel Class II, and 1 as Engel class III. All 12 children had contralateral hemianopia postoperatively and improvement in median IQ (p=0.04) was reported three months postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: With respect to the limits of a retrospective and relatively small sample size series TPO and PO disconnection are safe and effective motor-sparing epilepsy surgical procedures in selected patients with the epileptiform zone located in the posterior quadrant on one side.},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. Study Design. Review. Objective. To formally introduce "degenerative cervical myelopathy" (DCM) as the overarching term to describe the various degenerative conditions of the cervical spine that cause myelopathy. Herein, the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and genetics of conditions falling under this hypernym are carefully described. Summary of Background Data. Nontraumatic, degenerative forms of cervical myelopathy represent the commonest cause of spinal cord impairment in adults and include cervical spondylotic myelopathy, ossifi cation of the posterior longitudinal ligament, ossifi cation of the ligamentum flavum, and degenerative disc disease. Unfortunately, there is neither a specifi c term nor a specifi c diagnostic International Classifi cation of Diseases, Tenth Revision code to describe this collection of clinical entities. This has resulted in the inconsistent use of diagnostic terms when referring to patients with myelopathy due to degenerative disease of the cervical spine. Methods. Narrative review. Results. The incidence and prevalence of myelopathy due to degeneration of the spine are estimated at a minimum of 41 and 605 per million in North America, respectively. Incidence of cervical spondylotic myelopathy-related hospitalizations has been estimated at 4.04/100,000 person-years, and surgical rates seem to be rising. Pathophysiologically, myelopathy results from static compression, spinal malalignment leading to altered cord tension and vascular supply, and dynamic injury mechanisms. Occupational hazards, including transportation of goods by weight bearing on top of the head, and other risk factors may accelerate DCM development. Potential genetic factors include those related to MMP-2 and collagen IX for degenerative disc disease, and collagen VI and XI for ossifi cation of the posterior longitudinal ligament. In addition, congenital anomalies including spinal stenosis, Down syndrome, and Klippel-Feil syndrome may predispose to the development of DCM. Conclusion. Although DCMs can present as separate diagnostic entities, they are highly interrelated, frequently manifest concomitantly, present similarly from a clinical standpoint, and seem to be in part a response to compensate and improve stability due to progressive age and wear of the cervical spine. The use of the term "degenerative cervical myelopathy" is advocated.},

abstract = {22 Italian centres have joined together in a cooperative study aiming to define the ideal management of spontaneous posterior fossa haematomas. 205 cases have been evaluated: 155 cerebellar haematomas and 50 brainstem haematomas. Out of these, 190 cases, all studied by CT scan, are the subject of the present study. Cerebellar haematomas have been divided, according to a tomographic classification, into 3 groups: group 1 (4th ventricle not shifted), group 2 (4th ventricle shifted or obliterated) and group 3 (intraventricular blood). Each group has been subdivided into: A (no hydrocephalus), and B (hydrocephalus). Regardless of therapeutical modalities, mortality rate was 38{\%} for cerebellar haematomas; level of consciousness a few hours after haemorrhage and size of the lesion appeared to be significant prognostic factors. As a whole, medical treatment gave better results than surgical treatment. Considering each tomographical group in detail, surgery should be limited to patients in group 2B and 3B, especially when exhibiting neurological deterioration. For brainstem haematomas, overall mortality was 57{\%}. The possibility of survival was linked to the presence or absence of initial loss of consciousness and to the size of the lesion; while hydrocephalus did not influence the final outcome, ventricular blood was a risk factor. Surgical evacuation showed some value in chronic cases. However, medical treatment appears to be the best policy for brainstem haematomas of limited size; for larger lesions, the outcome appears to be uniformly fatal, regardless of the treatment employed.},

@article{Pitkanen1998,
abstract = {The amygdala complex is one component of the temporal lobe that may be damaged unilaterally or bilaterally in children and adults with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) or following status epilepticus. Most MR (magnetic resonance) imaging studies of epileptic patients have shown that volume reduction of the amygdala ranges from 10-30{\%}. In the human amygdala, neuronal loss and gliosis have been reported in the lateral and basal nuclei. Studies in rats have more specifically identified the amygdaloid regions that are sensitive to status epilepticus-induced neuronal damage. These areas include the medial division of the lateral nucleus, the parvicellular division of the basal nucleus, the accessory basal nucleus, the posterior cortical nucleus, and portions of the anterior cortical and medial nuclei. Otherwise, other amygdala nuclei, such as the magnocellular and intermediate divisions of the basal nucleus and the central nucleus, remain relatively well preserved. Amygdala kindling studies in rats have shown that the density of a subpopulation of GABAergic inhibitory neurons that also contain somatostatin may be reduced even after a low number of generalized seizures. While analyses of histological sections and MR images indicate that in approximately 10{\%} of TLE patients, seizure- induced damage is isolated to the amygdala, more often amygdala damage is combined with damage to the hippocampus and/or other brain areas. Moreover, recent data from rodents and nonhuman primates suggest that structural and functional alterations caused by seizure activity originating in the amygdala are not limited to the amygdala itself, but may also affect other temporal lobe structures. The information gathered so far on damage to the amygdala in epilepsy or after status epilepticus suggests that local alterations in inhibitory circuitries may contribute to a lowered seizure threshold and greater excitability within the amygdala. Furthermore, damage to select nuclei in the amygdala may predict impairment of performance in behavioral tasks that depend on the integrity of the amygdaloid circuits.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE The brain sulci constitute the main microanatomic delimiting landmarks and surgical corridors of modern microneurosurgery. Because of the frequent difficulty in intraoperatively localizing and visually identifying the brain sulci with assurance, the main purpose of this study was to establish cortical/sulcal key points of primary microneurosurgical importance to provide a sulcal anatomic framework for the placement of craniotomies and to facilitate the main sulci intraoperative identification. METHODS The study was performed through the evaluation of 32 formalin-fixed cerebral hemispheres of 16 adult cadavers, which had been removed from the skulls after the introduction of plastic catheters through properly positioned burr holes necessary for the evaluation of cranial-cerebral relationships. Three-dimensional anatomic and surgical images are displayed to illustrate the use of sulcal key points. RESULTS The points studied were the anterior sylvian point, the inferior rolandic point, the intersection of the inferior frontal sulcus with the precentral sulcus, the intersection of the superior frontal sulcus with the precentral sulcus, the superior rolandic point, the intersection of the intraparietal sulcus with the postcentral sulcus, the superior point of the parieto-occipital sulcus, the euryon (the craniometric point that corresponds to the center of the parietal tuberosity), the posterior point of the superior temporal sulcus, and the opisthocranion, which corresponds to the most prominent point of the occipital bossa. These points presented regular neural and cranial-cerebral relationships and can be considered consistent microsurgical cortical key points. CONCLUSION These sulcal and gyral key points can be particularly useful for initial intraoperative sulci identification and dissection. Together, they compose a framework that can help in the understanding of hemispheric lesion localization, in the placement of supratentorial craniotomies, as landmarks for the transsulcal approaches to periventricular and intraventricular lesions, and in orienting the anatomic removal of gyral sectors that contain infiltrative tumors.},

abstract = {This article is based on a consensus conference, which took place in Certosa di Pontignano, Siena (Italy) on March 7-9, 2008, intended to update the previous safety guidelines for the application of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in research and clinical settings. Over the past decade the scientific and medical community has had the opportunity to evaluate the safety record of research studies and clinical applications of TMS and repetitive TMS (rTMS). In these years the number of applications of conventional TMS has grown impressively, new paradigms of stimulation have been developed (e.g., patterned repetitive TMS) and technical advances have led to new device designs and to the real-time integration of TMS with electroencephalography (EEG), positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Thousands of healthy subjects and patients with various neurological and psychiatric diseases have undergone TMS allowing a better assessment of relative risks. The occurrence of seizures (i.e., the most serious TMS-related acute adverse effect) has been extremely rare, with most of the few new cases receiving rTMS exceeding previous guidelines, often in patients under treatment with drugs which potentially lower the seizure threshold. The present updated guidelines review issues of risk and safety of conventional TMS protocols, address the undesired effects and risks of emerging TMS interventions, the applications of TMS in patients with implanted electrodes in the central nervous system, and safety aspects of TMS in neuroimaging environments. We cover recommended limits of stimulation parameters and other important precautions, monitoring of subjects, expertise of the rTMS team, and ethical issues. While all the recommendations here are expert based, they utilize published data to the extent possible. {\textcopyright} 2009 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.},

abstract = {OBJECT: The authors in this study evaluated muscle motor evoked potentials (MMEPs) elicited by transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) and direct cortical stimulation as a means of monitoring during cerebral aneurysm surgery. The analysis focused on the value and frequencies of any intraoperative changes and their correlation to the postoperative motor status. METHODS: One hundred nineteen patients undergoing surgery for 148 cerebral aneurysms were included in the study. Muscle motor evoked potentials were elicited by a train of five constant-current anodal stimuli with an individual pulse duration of 0.5 msec and a stimulation rate of 2 Hz. Stimulation intensity was up to 240 mA for TES and up to 33 mA for direct cortical stimulation. The MMEPs were continuously recorded from the abductor pollicis brevis and tibialis anterior muscles bilaterally and from the biceps brachii and extensor digitorum communis muscles contralateral to the surgical side. The motor status was evaluated immediately after surgery and 7 days later. In 97{\%} of the patients MMEPs were recordable for continuous neurophysiological monitoring of the vascular territory of interest throughout the surgery. In 14 patients significant intraoperative MMEP changes occurred, resulting in a transient motor deficit in one patient and a permanent motor deficit in six. The permanent loss of MMEPs in three patients was followed by a permanent severe motor deficit in one patient and severe clinical deterioration in the other two. CONCLUSIONS: Data in this study demonstrated that MMEPs are a useful means of intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring of motor pathway integrity and predicting postoperative motor status. The intraoperative loss of MMEPs reliably predicts both severe and permanent postoperative motor deficits.},

It is the preferred approach for removal of all tumors in patients with poor hearing and for large tumors when the likelihood of hearing preservation is slight. This approach offers the advantages of minimum cerebellar retraction, identification of the facial nerve proximally and medially, and the ability to repair immediately the facial nerve if it is severed during acoustic tumor removal. This approach has the lowest morbidity with regard to spinal fluid leaks and also postoperative headaches.},

abstract = {Anaesthetic techniques for awake craniotomy have been evolving over many years and include local anaesthesia and sedation or true asleep-awake-asleep techniques using general anaesthesia with intra-operative wake-up. The key advantage of awake techniques is the ability to assess the patient's neurological status during surgery, although this benefit has to be balanced against the loss of control of ventilation and assurance of immobility. However, the use of short-acting anaesthetic agents provide good operating conditions for the neurosurgeon whilst ensuring intraoperative cooperation from a comfortable patient. It is well tolerated by patients and minor procedures can be performed as a day case or with one overnight stay. The neuroanaesthetist plays a key role in the perioperative management of this challenging procedure.},

The authors provide evidence that cervical spondylotic myelopathy, a slow progressive compression injury to the cord and arguably the most prevalent form of spinal cord injury, also involves innate immune responses that contribute to neuronal and oligodendrocyte death, similar to that seen in acute spinal cord injury. They found evidence for both Fas ligand and Fas in human cervical spinal cords from patients with significant cervical spondylotic myelopathy that also exhibited the classical pathological signs of neuronal loss and axon degeneration. The work of represents a promising trend in translational neuroscience: the development of animal models of CNS injury that are driven by unmet needs for information on the aetiology and treatment of growing clinical problems. The twy/twy mouse is one approach, but other translational models of slow compressive injury to the cord will also be needed to provide means for evaluating therapeutic strategies for this increasingly important clinical entity.

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Subgroup analyses according to treatment received. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether baseline radiographic findings predicted outcomes in patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The spine patient outcomes research trial combined randomized and observational DS cohorts. METHODS: The Meyerding listhesis grade was determined on the neutral radiograph (n = 222). Patients were classified as having low disc height if disc height was less than 5 mm. Flexion-extension radiographs (n = 185) were evaluated for mobility. Those with greater than 10 degrees rotation or 4 mm translation were considered hypermobile. Changes in outcome measures were compared between listhesis (grade 1 vs. grade 2), disc height (low vs. normal), and mobility (stable vs. hypermobile) groups using longitudinal regression models adjusted for potential confounders. Outcome measures included SF-36 bodily pain and physical function scales, oswestry disability index (ODI), stenosis bothersomeness index, and low back pain bothersomeness scale. RESULTS: Overall, 86{\%} had a grade 1 listhesis, 78{\%} had normal disc height, and 73{\%} were stable. Baseline symptom severity was similar between groups. Overall, surgery patients improved more than patients treated nonoperatively. At 1 year, outcomes were similar in surgery patients across listhesis, disc height, and mobility groups (ODI: grade 1 -23.7 vs. grade 2 -23.3, P = 0.90; normal disc height -23.5 vs. low disc height -21.9, P = 0.66; stable -21.6 vs. hypermobile -25.2, P = 0.30). Among those treated nonoperatively, grade 1 patients improved more than grade 2 patients (bodily pain + 13.1 vs. -4.9, P = 0.019; ODI -8.0 vs. + 4.8, P = 0.010 at 1 year), and hypermobile patients improved more than stable patients (ODI -15.2 vs. -6.6, P = 0.041; stenosis bothersomeness index -7.8 vs. -2.7, P = 0.002 at 1 year). DISCUSSION: Regardless of listhesis grade, disc height or mobility, patients who had surgery improved more than those treated nonoperatively. These differences were due, in part, to differences in nonoperative outcomes, which were better in patients classified as grade 1 or hypermobile.},

abstract = {PURPOSE About one-third of individuals with focal epilepsy continue to have seizures despite optimal medical management. These patients are potentially curable with neurosurgery if the epileptogenic zone (EZ) can be identified and resected. Stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) to record epileptic activity with intracranial depth electrodes may be required to identify the EZ. Each SEEG electrode trajectory, the path between the entry on the skull and the cerebral target, must be planned carefully to avoid trauma to blood vessels and conflicts between electrodes. In current clinical practice trajectories are determined manually, typically taking 2-3 h per patient (15 min per electrode). Manual planning (MP) aims to achieve an implantation plan with good coverage of the putative EZ, an optimal spatial resolution, and 3D distribution of electrodes. Computer-assisted planning tools can reduce planning time by quantifying trajectory suitability. METHODS We present an automated multiple trajectory planning (MTP) algorithm to compute implantation plans. MTP uses dynamic programming to determine a set of plans. From this set a depth-first search algorithm finds a suitable plan. We compared our MTP algorithm to (a) MP and (b) an automated single trajectory planning (STP) algorithm on 18 patient plans containing 165 electrodes. RESULTS MTP changed all 165 trajectories compared to MP. Changes resulted in lower risk (122), increased grey matter sampling (99), shorter length (92), and surgically preferred entry angles (113). MTP changed 42 {\%} (69/165) trajectories compared to STP. Every plan had between 1 to 8 (median 3.5) trajectories changed to resolve electrode conflicts, resulting in surgically preferred plans. CONCLUSION MTP is computationally efficient, determining implantation plans containing 7-12 electrodes within 1 min, compared to 2-3 h for MP.},

abstract = {OBJECT: Spontaneous intracranial hypotension is a noteworthy but commonly misdiagnosed cause of new daily persistent headaches. Subdural fluid collections are frequent radiographic findings, but they can be interpreted as primary rather than secondary pathological entities, and uncertainties exist regarding their optimal management. The authors therefore reviewed their experience with subdural fluid collections in 40 consecutive patients with spontaneous spinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks and intracranial hypotension. METHODS: The mean age of the 26 female and 14 male patients was 43 years (range 13-72 years). Subdural fluid collections were present in 20 patients (50{\%}); 12 of these patients (60{\%}) had subdural hygromas alone, and eight (40{\%}) had subacute to chronic subdural hematomas (SDHs) associated with significant mass effect. The subdural hygromas resolved within several days to weeks following treatment of the underlying CSF leak. Three patients with SDHs underwent evacuation of the hematoma prior to the establishment of the diagnosis of spontaneous intracranial hypotension, but the SDHs did not resolve until the underlying spinal CSF leak was treated. In the remaining five patients, the CSF leak was treated primarily and the SDHs resolved over a 1- to 3-month period without the need for evacuation. CONCLUSIONS: Subdural fluid collections are common in spontaneous intracranial hypotension, varying in appearance from thin subdural hygromas to large SDHs associated with significant mass effect. These collections can be safely managed by directing treatment at the underlying CSF leak without the need for hematoma evacuation.},

abstract = {Purpose To compare diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters of the spinal cord between patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) and normal subjects, and investigate their significance in the clinical diagnosis, surgical planning and post-operative evaluation of CSM. Methods Routine sequence magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and DTI scans were performed in 50 normal subjects and 60 cases of CSM with 3.0-T MR. DTI images, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) colormaps corresponding to spinal cord cross-sections were obtained. The spinal cord function of CSM patients was measured using modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) scoring and Nurick grade at different times. The changes in DTI parameters and their correlation with spinal cord function scores were analysed by SPSS 19. Results There were significant differences in DTI parameters of the spinal cord between normal subjects and patients with CSM (ADC: 1.119 ± 0.087 vs. 1.395 ± 0.091, P {\textless} 0.01; FA: 0.661 ± 0.057 vs. 0.420 ± 0.080, P {\textless} 0.01). The FA values at the maximal compression level of the spinal cord in the patients with CSM were significantly associated with the mJOA score pre-operatively, 1 week, and 1, 3 and 6 months post-operatively, with Pearson's correlation coefficients of 0.58 (P {\textless} 0.01), 0.53 (P {\textless} 0.05), and 0.51 (P {\textless} 0.05), 0.54 (P {\textless} 0.05) and 0.55 (P {\textless} 0.05), respectively. However, the FA values were significantly negatively associated with the Nurick grade, with Pearson's correlation coefficients of − 0.40 (P {\textless} 0.05), − 0.39 (P {\textless} 0.05), and -0.41 (P {\textless} 0.05), − 0.45 (P {\textless} 0.05) and − 0.44 (P {\textless} 0.05), respectively.

abstract = {Diffuse low-grade glioma (DLGG) is a growing pre-cancerous tumor, often diagnosed in patients with no or only mild deficit. Maximal and early surgical resection is currently the first therapeutic option, in order to delay the malignant transformation and thus increase the overall survival. Preserving the quality of life (QoL) is nonetheless another priority. Here, our purpose is to weight the value of the extent of resection versus the neurological worsening that could be voluntarily generated by a radical resection; that is, to study the "onco-functional balance" at the individual level. To this end, we will examine DLGG involving the supplementary motor area and DLGG involving visual pathways. We will consider the benefit-risk ratio of different strategies of resection, according to the brain structures actually invaded and their plastic potential. The aim is to increase both the quantity of life and the time with a normal QoL, on the basis of strong interactions between the tumor course, brain reorganization and multistage surgical approach adapted to each patient over time. To this end, beyond the conceptual and technical issues, the most important point remains the honest and unique relationship between the surgical oncologist and the patient, based on clear and complete information about the behavior of DLGG versus the expected medical and social consequences of a resection over years. In other words, in the era of "evidence-based medicine", it is crucial to not forget "individual-based medicine" by offering tailored resections adapted to each patient.},

In serious cases, SIH patients who present with SDHs develop neurological deficits, a decreased level of consciousness, or cerebral herniation, and may even require an urgent neurosurgical drainage. Despite numerous pub-lications on SDHs, few report its potential risk factors in patients with SIH. In this study, we retrospectively investigated 93 consecutive SIH patients and divided them into an SDH group (n = 25) and a non-SDH (NSDH) group (n = 68). The clinical and radiographic charac-teristics of these 93 patients were analyzed, and then univariate analysis and further multi-ple logistic regression analysis were performed to identify the potential risk factors for the development of SDHs. The univariate analysis showed that advanced age, male gender, longer clinical course, dural enhancement, and the venous distension sign were associated with the development of SDHs. However, multivariate analysis only included the latter three factors. Our study reveals important radiological manifestations for predicting the develop-ment of SDHs in patients with SIH.},

abstract = {A series of 28 ependymomas arising in the filum terminale was divided into two groups based on the presence/absence of connections with the conus medullaris and/or roots of the cauda equina. Group A comprised ependymomas having no connections with the contiguous structures and group B those either infiltrating or adhering to such structures. Factors having a positive influence on the prognosis (risk of recurrence) were: 1) clinical history under one year (p {\textless} 0.01); 2) confinement of tumour to the filum terminale (p {\textless} 0.01); 3) total tumour removal (p {\textless} 0.05). Postoperative radiotherapy had no appreciable effect on outcome. The combination of significant factors was in turn significantly influenced by the mode of tumour growth, which proved to be the cardinal factor in prognosis. This point is examined in the light of the published work.},

abstract = {Systematic review and survey. To perform an evidence synthesis of the literature and obtain information from the global spine care community assessing the frequency, timing, and predictors of symptom development in patients with radiographical evidence of cervical spinal cord compression, spinal canal narrowing, and/or ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) but no symptoms of myelopathy. Evidence for a marker to predict symptom development remains sparse, and there is controversy surrounding the management of asymptomatic patients. We conducted a systematic review of the English language literature and an international survey of spine surgeons to answer the following key questions in patients with radiographical evidence of cervical spinal cord compression, spinal canal narrowing, and/or OPLL but no symptoms of myelopathy: (1) What are the frequency and timing of symptom development? (2) What are the clinical, radiographical, and electrophysiological predictors of symptom development? (3) What clinical and/or radiographical features influence treatment decisions based on an international survey of spine care professionals? The initial literature search yielded 388 citations. Applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria narrowed this to 5 articles. Two of these dealt with the same population. For patients with spinal cord compression secondary to spondylosis, one study reported the frequency of myelopathy development to be 22.6{\%}. The presence of symptomatic radiculopathy, cervical cord hyperintensity on magnetic resonance imaging, and prolonged somatosensory- and motor-evoked potentials were reported in one study as significant independent predictors of myelopathy development. In contrast, the lack of magnetic resonance imaging hyperintensity was found to be a positive predictor of early myelopathy development (≤ 12-mo follow-up). For subjects with OPLL, frequency of myelopathy development was reported in 3 articles and ranged from 0.0{\%} to 61.5{\%} of subjects. One of these studies reported canal stenosis of 60{\%} or more, lateral deviated OPLL, and increased cervical range of motion as significant predictors of myelopathy development. In a survey of 774 spine surgeons, the majority deemed the presence of clinically symptomatic radiculopathy to predict progression to myelopathy in nonmyelopathic patients with cervical stenosis. Survey responses pertaining to 3 patient case vignettes are also presented and discussed in the context of the current literature. On the basis of these results, we provide a series of evidence-based recommendations related to the frequency, timing, and predictors of myelopathy development in asymptomatic patients with cervical stenosis secondary to spondylosis or OPLL. Future prospective studies are required to refine our understanding of this topic. EVIDENCE-BASED CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS: Patients with cervical canal stenosis and cord compression secondary to spondylosis, without clinical evidence of myelopathy, and who present with clinical or electrophysiological evidence of cervical radicular dysfunction or central conduction deficits seem to be at higher risk for developing myelopathy and should be counseled to consider surgical treatment. OVERALL STRENGTH OF EVIDENCE: Moderate. Strong. SUMMARY STATEMENTS: STATEMENT 1: On the basis of the current literature, for patients with cervical canal stenosis and cord compression secondary to spondylosis, without clinical evidence of myelopathy, approximately 8{\%} at 1-year follow-up and 23{\%} at a median of 44-months follow-up develop clinical evidence of myelopathy. STATEMENT 2: For patients with cervical canal stenosis and cord compression secondary to spondylosis, without clinical evidence of myelopathy, the absence of magnetic resonance imaging intramedullary T2 hyperintensity has been shown to predict early myelopathy development ({\textless}12-mo follow-up) and the presence of such signal has been shown to predict late myelopathy development (mean 44-mo follow-up). In light of this discrepancy, no definite recommendation can be made surrounding the utility of this finding in predicting myelopathy development. STATEMENT 3: For patients with OPLL but without myelopathy, no recommendation can be made regarding the incidence or predictors of progression to myelopathy.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess feasibility and clinical value of motor evoked potential (MEP) monitoring with surgery close to supratentorial motor areas and pathways. METHODS: Functional mapping by somatosensory evoked potential phase reversal and continuous MEP recording after high-frequency repetitive electrical cortex stimulation was performed during 182 operations in 177 patients. Significant MEP changes were reported to trigger surgical reaction. Intraoperative surgical and electrophysiological findings were documented prospectively. Patient files were reviewed for clinical data. MEP monitoring results were correlated with motor outcome. RESULTS: MEP recording was successful in 167 cases (91.8{\%}). Inadequate electrode placement was an important reason for failed recording in the remaining patients, whereas preoperative paresis and anesthesia had no significant effect. Permanently disabling new motor deficit occurred in 8 cases (4.9{\%}), whereas transient and nondisabling weakness was frequent (27.4{\%}). Significant MEP changes occurred during 64 operations (39{\%}). Irreversible MEP loss always predicted new, usually permanent, paresis. Unaltered MEP recordings indicated unimpaired motor function in the monitored muscle groups, except for rare transient deficit because of late edema and rebleeding. Irreversible MEP deterioration without loss and reversible changes could be associated with new paresis, which was transient in most patients. No major complications were observed, except for intraoperative generalized seizure in one epilepsy patient under insufficient anticonvulsant therapy. CONCLUSION: MEP monitoring with supratentorial surgery is feasible and safe. It may help to maximize resection within the limits of preserved motor function. Further evidence is needed to confirm these results.},

The treatment options currently available for vestibular schwannomas include observation with serial imaging, stereotactic radiation, and microsurgical removal. Although the ultimate goal in treatment of vestibular schwannomas is preservation of life, the best option for each patient depends on symptoms, tumor size, tumor location, and the patient's general health and age. Surgical exposure of the cerebellopontine angle for removal of vestibular schwannomas can be performed safely via a translabyrinthine, retrosigmoid, and middle fossa approach. Each approach has its advantages and disadvantages. The goal of surgery is complete eradication of tumor with preservation of hearing and facial nerve function when possible. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most deadly cancers in humans. Despite recent advances in anti-cancer therapies, most patients with GBM die from local disease progression. Fluorescence image guided surgical resection (FIGR) was recently advocated to enhance local control of GBM. This is meta-analyses of 5-aminolevulinic (5-ALA) induced FIGR. MATERIALS: Review of the literature produced 503 potential publications; only 20 of these fulfilled the inclusion criteria of this analysis, including a total of 565 patients treated with 5-ALA-FIGR reporting on its outcomes and 800 histological samples reporting 5-ALA-FIGR sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: The mean gross total resection (GTR) rate was 75.4{\%} (95{\%} CI: 67.4-83.5, p{\textless}0.001). The mean time to tumor progression (TTP) was 8.1 months (95{\%} CI: 4.7-12, p{\textless}0.001). The mean overall survival gain reported was 6.2 months (95{\%} CI: -1-13, p{\textless}0.001). The specificity was 88.9{\%} (95{\%} CI: 83.9-93.9, p{\textless}0.001) and the sensitivity was 82.6{\%} (95{\%} CI: 73.9-91.9, p{\textless}0.001). CONCLUSION: 5-ALA-FIGR in GBM is highly sensitive and specific, and imparts significant benefits to patients in terms of improved GTR and TTP.},

abstract = {Background Decreased level of consciousness is a rare neurological manifestation of spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH), which typically presents with orthostatic headache. The optimal management of this uncommon presentation remains uncertain.Methods We analyzed the presentation, management and outcome of two patients in our institution and reviewed 22 patients reported in the literature with SIH and decreased level of consciousness, defined as any decrease in the patient's Glasgow Coma Scale score.Results There were 20 male and four female patients (M:F ratio of 5:1) with an average age of 52 years (range 37 to 68 years). There was a variable time interval of up to many months between the initial presentation of SIH and changes in the level of consciousness. An epidural autologous blood patch was eventually successful in 79{\%} of the patients, although up to three trials were necessary in seven of these patients. Intrathecal saline infusion used as a temporizing measure resulted in excellent response within hours in five out of six patients who received this treatment. Drainage of the subdural collection either did not result in any sustained improvement or resulted in clinical deterioration in 12 out of 12 patients who received this treatment.Conclusions In the absence of a clinical trial because of the rarity of this entity, the treatment of SIH complicated by decreased level of consciousness remained controversial in the past. However, current collective experience supports early treatment of patients with SIH and decreased level of consciousness with one or more epidural blood patches. Fibrin glue and surgical duroplasty are the next steps in the management of patients in whom epidural blood patches fail. Drainage of the subdural collections may be detrimental. },

abstract = {Sacral fractures are rare and seldom result in formation of a sacral pseudomeningocele. Treatment of these pseudomeningoceles usually consists of conservative management with flat bedrest or open operative management. The authors describe the case of a 55-year-old woman with an anterior sacral pseudomeningocele that was successfully treated using a lumbar drain for temporary continuous CSF drainage. The patient first presented to an outside institution several days after sacral trauma from an ice skating fall. Initial symptoms included throbbing headaches relieved by lying flat. Head and cervical spine CT demonstrated no abnormality. As symptoms worsened, she presented to another institution where MRI of the lumbar spine indicated sacral fracture with pseudomeningocele. The patient subsequently transferred to the authors' facility, where symptoms included headaches and occasional mild sacral pain. Given her headaches and the authors' concern for CSF leak, another head CT scan was performed. This revealed no subdural hematoma or other abnormality. A subsequent CT myelogram revealed an anterior sacral pseudomeningocele at S3-4 with an anterior irregular linear filling defect, likely representing torn dura. Treatment included placement of a lumbar drain (10 ml/hr) and flat bedrest. Resolution of the CSF leak occurred on postprocedure Day 9. At the 4-week follow-up visit, the patient had no clinical symptoms of CSF leak and no neurological complaints. To our knowledge, this is the first description of temporary continuous CSF drainage used to treat a posttraumatic sacral pseudomeningocele. This technique may reduce the need for potentially complicated surgical repair of sacral fractures associated with CSF leak in select patients.},

abstract = {Primary spinal cord tumors constitute 2{\%} to 4{\%} of all central nervous system neoplasms and are characterized based on their location as intramedullary, intradural extramedullary, and extradural. A contemporary literature review of primary intradural spinal cord tumors was performed. Among intramedullary tumors, ependymomas are more common and often can be surgically resected. However, astrocytomas infiltrate the spinal cord and complete resection is rare. Intradural extramedullary tumors include schwannomas, neurofibromas, and meningiomas and are usually amenable to surgical resection. Radiotherapy is reserved for malignant variants and recurrent gliomas, whereas chemotherapy is administered for recurrent primary spinal cord tumors without surgical or radiotherapy options. Early recognition of the signs and symptoms related to primary spinal cord tumors facilitates timely discovery, treatment, potentially minimizes neurologic morbidity, and may improve outcome. Treatment consists of surgical resection, and predictors of outcome include preoperative functional status, histologic grade of tumor, and extent of surgical resection.},

@article{Wieser2001,
abstract = {BACKGROUND::Reoperations account for {\textgreater}10{\%} in pediatric epilepsy surgery cohorts and they are especially relevant in young children with catastrophic epilepsy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE::To determine surgical outcomes and their predictive factors in reoperations for refractory epilepsy in childhood.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS::We retrospectively analyzed presurgical findings, resections and outcomes of 23 consecutive children that underwent reoperations from 2000-2011.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS::Etiology included cortical dysplasia with/without glioneuronal tumor in 19 patients (83{\%}), sole glioneuronal tumor in 2, and tuberous sclerosis and Rasmussen's encephalitis in one each. Reasons for failure of initial surgery were functional considerations in 8 (35{\%}), incorrect delineation of the epileptogenic zone in 8 (35{\%}), and resection not performed as initially planned in 7 (30{\%}) cases. Final procedures included 8 (35{\%}) intralobar, 8 (35{\%}) multilobar resections and 7 (30{\%}) hemispherotomies. Following reoperations, 14 (61{\%}) patients were seizure-free, 6 (26{\%}) showed significant or worthwhile improvement, and 3 (13{\%}) failed to respond to surgery. Six of 8 patients that underwent the first resection before the age of 3 years, 6 of 8 whose first resection was limited by functional considerations, and all 7 with hemispherotomy as the final resection achieved seizure freedom after reoperation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION::Reoperation is particularly beneficial for selected children with refractory epilepsy associated with cortical dysplasia that failed to respond to an initial limited and/or early resection but achieved seizure freedom after extensive procedures. When indicated, reoperation should be performed at the youngest possible age to profit from higher functional plasticity in compensating for neurologic deficit.},
